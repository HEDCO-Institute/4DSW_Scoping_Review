Compared to traditional systematic reviews estimating the effects of interventions, scoping reviews explore the breadth of the literature on a topic, identify the types of available evidence, and chart and summarize this evidence (Peters et al., 2020). Scoping reviews are particularly useful for examining evidence on emerging topics to inform specific questions that can be valuably answered in future evidence syntheses. Consequently, a scoping review can provide useful insights about the nature and state of available research evidence in the 4DSW literature. "],["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Eligibility Criteria 2.2 Information Sources 2.3 Search Strategy 2.4 Selection Process of Sources of Evidence 2.5 Data Charting Process and Items 2.6 Synthesis of Results", " 2 Methods We drafted this manuscript using the PRISMA extension for reporting literature searches in systematic reviews (Rethlefsen et al., 2021), the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (Tricco et al., 2018), and JBI guidance on scoping reviews (Peters et al., 2020). We prospectively registered the review protocol on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/xcthk). 2.1 Eligibility Criteria We included empirical studies examining the 4DSW at primary and secondary schools in the United States (see Table 1). We excluded studies that focused on variations in traditional school calendars in the United States other than reducing the traditional five-day school week (5DSW) to a 4DSW (e.g., extending the length of the school year). We also excluded studies in pre-school or postsecondary school, as well as studies taking place outside of the United States. The population of interest is any stakeholder relevant to primary and secondary schools in the United States (including students, parents, teachers, and other school staff). We included all research designs that involved the collection and analysis of empirical data; we also included studies that used computational modeling to simulate empirical data. We excluded conceptual papers, opinion articles, narrative literature reviews, and non-research sources (e.g., news articles). We included grey literature unless we could not obtain the full-text (e.g., conference abstracts, unavailable dissertations). Due to limitations in resources and language proficiency, we excluded studies published in a language other than English. 2.2 Information Sources We searched for eligible studies on 23 May 2023 using the following electronic databases (with search platforms in parentheses): PubMed (National Library of Medicine), ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I (ProQuest), and Social Science Premium Collection (ProQuest). The Social Science Premium Collection includes the Criminology Collection, Education Collection (which includes Education Resources Information Center, or ERIC), International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Library &amp; Information Science Collection, Linguistics Collection, Politics Collection, Social Science Database, and Sociology Collection. We did not contact authors nor search study registries, web search engines, specific web sites, or journal tables of contents. 2.3 Search Strategy A copy of the full search strategy is available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ryva8/). We developed the search strategy using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) Guideline (McGowan et al., 2016) and terms common in studies identified in a preliminary scan of the literature on Google Scholar. The search strategy did not involve the use of any published search filters. We uploaded the citations into a web-based systematic review data management software (DistillerSR). We used DistillerSR to detect and remove duplicate citations prior to the process of screening citations for eligibility. 2.4 Selection Process of Sources of Evidence A copy of the selection process codebook is available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ryva8/). We used standardized forms in DistillerSR and did not blind selectors to journal titles or study authors and their institutions. First, one PhD-level reviewer (SG or ED) and at least one undergraduate reviewer (BC, SH, or SM) screened the title and abstract of each citation for potentially eligible studies. Then, we retrieved full texts for each citation deemed potentially eligible. One PhD-level reviewer (SG or ED) and at least one undergraduate reviewer (BC, SH, or SM) assessed each full-text for eligibility, recording reasons for excluding citations. We used the PRISMA2020 R package (Haddaway et al., 2022) to visually summarize the search and selection process via a flow diagram with the number of records screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the scoping review (Page et al., 2021; Tricco et al., 2018). 2.5 Data Charting Process and Items Charting the results involved an iterative process of continually updating the charting items to ensure that we extracted all relevant information (Peters et al., 2020; Tricco et al., 2018). A copy of the final data charting codebook is available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/yrk2w/). One PhD-level reviewer (SG or ED) and at least one undergraduate reviewer (BC, SH, or SM) independently collected data from each eligible article using DistillerSR. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. We collected bibliographic information (e.g., authors, year published), information related to the review question (i.e., concept, context, population), and methodological characteristics (e.g., research design). As the purposes of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, we did not critically appraise the included sources of evidence (Tricco et al., 2018). 2.6 Synthesis of Results We used the GRADE Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework to group and summarize the types of empirical research evidence available on the 4DSW (Alonso-Coello et al., 2016). We described key parameters (characteristics of the sources of evidence and the types of empirical research evidence) through simple frequency counts.

After we removed 255 duplicates, we identified a total of 2,814 unique citations. During title and abstract screening, we excluded 2,355 citations, leaving 459 citations to retrieve for full-text eligibility assessment. Of the 441 citations that we could retrieve, we excluded 310 citations. The remaining 131 manuscripts eligible for this scoping review reported on 111 unique studies. 3.1 Characteristics of Sources of Evidence We identified 111 studies reporting empirical research on the four-day school week in the United States (see Table 2). Of these 111 published manuscripts, only 27 (24%) were peer-reviewed journal articles, while an additional 12 (11%) manuscripts were self-published reports and 2 (2%) were working papers pre-printed before journal peer review. The majority of articles (n = 70; 63%) were student manuscripts. Of these 70 student manuscripts, 57 were doctoral dissertations (81% of the student manuscripts), 11 were masters theses (16% of the student manuscripts), and 2 were undergraduate theses (3% of the student manuscripts). The vast majority of student manuscripts were in partial fulfillment of degrees in education (n = 62; 89% of the student manuscripts), followed by economics (n = 4; 6% of the student manuscripts), psychology (n = 2; 3% of the student manuscripts), sociology (n = 1; 1% of the student manuscripts), and music (n = 1; 1% of the student manuscripts). The manuscripts were published from 1980 to 2023 (median of 2020) and analyzed data from 1975 to 2022 (median of 2011). Studies predominantly examined the 4DSW in rural communities (n = 82; 74%), though numerous studies also examined the 4DSW in urban (n = 26; 23%) and suburban communities (n = 24; 22%). In terms of grade and school level, studies predominantly examined the 4DSW in Grades 3, 5, 8, and 11 (n = 66 each; 59% each)although the number of studies was fairly evenly distributed across elementary (n = 81; 73%), middle (n = 77; 69%), and high (n = 81; 73%) school levels. Most studies (n = 67; 60%) studies did not report the race/ethnicity of students in the study sample. Of the 44 studies that did report student race/ethnicity data, the vast majority (n = 38; 34%) had a majority of students who identified as white. The majority of students identified as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish in four studies (4%), American Indian or Alaska Native in one study (1%), and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander in one study (1%). In terms of the type of 4DSW under investigation, most studies (n = 60; 54%) did not report what schools did on the fifth day for any districts in their sample. Of the 51 studies that did report this information, most studies involved either schools offering no activities (n =35; 32%) or teacher in-service (n = 33; 30%) on the fifth day. Regarding states (see Figure 2), studies predominantly examined the 4DSW in Missouri (n = 33; 30%), Colorado (n = 26; 23%), Oklahoma (n = 18; 16%), Oregon (n = 17; 15%), New Mexico (n = 13; 12%), South Dakota (n = 12; 11%), and Idaho (n = 11; 10%). 3.2 Empirical Research Evidence on the Priority of the Four-Day School Week Of these 111 published manuscripts, 3 (3%) reported empirical research evidence on the four-day school week as a priority: i.e., evidence on the extent of four-day school week policy adoption. Two journal articles were published in 2021: Anglum and Park (2021) analyzed data from 2010 through 2019, while Thompson et al. (2021) analyzed data from 1999 through 2019. Anglum and Park (2021) focused on district adoption of the four-day school week across the 516 school districts in Missouri, while Thompson et al. (2021) conducted a comprehensive national assessment across 24 states in which they identified at last one school district with at least one school that had adopted a four-day school week. These states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. One report from the National Center for Education Statistics (2020) used data from the 201718 National Teacher and Principal Survey to examine characteristics of the 2% of public schools where students attend classes fewer than five days per week. 3.3 Empirical Research Evidence on the Effects and Equitability of the Four-Day School Week Of these 111 published manuscripts, 71 (64%) reported empirical research evidence on the effectiveness of the four-day school week. To assess effectiveness, 15 studies (21% of the 71 effectiveness studies) used either difference-in-differences or descriptive statistics only, 14 studies (20%) used a before-after design, 13 (18%) used a between-group design without statistical controls (ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U test, MANOVA, t-test), seven (10%) used a between-group design with statistical controls (multilevel regression, multiple linear regression), five (7%) used a matched-pair design, and two (3%) used a computational model to examine simulated data. Effectiveness outcomes included educational achievement (n = 50; 70% of the 71 effectiveness studies), attendance (n = 22; 31%), health status and health-related behaviors (n = 8; 11%), teacher retention (n = 8; 11%), educational attainment (n = 7; 10%), school climate (n = 7; 10%), school disciplinary incidents (n = 5; 7%), household impacts (n = 4; 6%), and criminal activity (n = 2; 3%). Most effectiveness studies (n = 40; 56% of the 71 effectiveness studies) examined equitability of 4DSW effects: 28 effectiveness studies (39%) examined equitability of effects in relation to student ages or grade levels, eight (11%) by community rurality, eight (11%) by student socioeconomic status, six (8%) by student race and/or ethnicity, five (7%) by student sex or gender identity, four (6%) by student special education status, three (4%) by English language learner status, two (3%) by gifted student status, and one (1%) by immigrant status. 3.4 Empirical Research Evidence on the Implementability of the Four-Day School Week Of these 111 published manuscripts, 69 (62%) reported empirical research evidence on implementation of the four-day school week. To assess implementation, 45 studies (41%) examined acceptability, 36 studies (32%) examined feasibility, and 29 studies (26%) examined resource use. The acceptability studies examined satisfaction with the 4DSW among teachers (n = 33; 73% of the 45 acceptability studies), parents (n = 19; 42%), administrators (n = 17; 38%), students (n = 14; 31%), community members (n = 10; 22%), principals (n = 8; 18%), school staff (n = 8; 18%), superintendents (n = 7; 16%), and the athletics department, business owners, school board members, and counselors (n = 2 each; 4% each).
