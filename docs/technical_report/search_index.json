Compared to traditional systematic reviews estimating the effects of interventions, scoping reviews explore the breadth of the literature on a topic, identify the types of available evidence, and chart and summarize this evidence (Peters et al., 2020). Scoping reviews are particularly useful for examining evidence on emerging topics to inform specific questions that can be valuably answered in future evidence syntheses. Consequently, a scoping review can provide useful insights about the nature and state of available research evidence in the 4DSW literature. 1.1 Abstract The four-day school week (4DSW) is an alternative schedule gaining popularity among K-12 schools in the United States, with a resultant growing body of empirical research. This scoping review examined the extent and types of published empirical research evidence on the 4DSW. As of April 2025, we located 133 empirical research studies on the 4DSW in U.S. K-12 schools. The majority of studies provided evidence on the effectiveness of 4DSWs (n = 86; 65%), examined 4DSWs in rural communities (n = 97; 73%), and are published in grey literature (n = 102; 77%). We created an online interactive database for stakeholders to explore the diverse types of available evidence for studies most relevant to their specific contexts and informational needs. "],["background.html", "2 Background", " 2 Background The four-day school week (4DSW) is an alternative school schedule in which students only attend school four days per week, with schools attempting to compensate for lost instructional time by increasing the school day or school calendar year. Historically, school districts have switched to the 4DSW primarily for anticipated cost savings and attendance issues commonly faced by schools located in rural communities (Thompson et al., 2021). Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, districts are increasingly considering the 4DSW as a non-pecuniary benefit for teachers and staff (Camp et al., 2024).. This alternative school schedule is gaining popularity among K-12 schools in the United States, as more than 2,100 schools in nearly 900 districts across 26 states have adopted a 4DSW (Morton et al., 2024). As a result of interest in the 4DSW across the United States, a growing body of empirical research aims to provide stakeholders information on its effects and implementability. For example, numerous studies have examined whether the 4DSW achieves its stated aims on cost-savings (Morton, 2021; Thompson, 2021), student attendance (Morton, 2023; Thompson et al., 2022), and teacher recruitment and retention (Camp et al., 2024; Maiden et al., 2020). In addition, educational stakeholders are concerned about potential unintended negative and inequitable impacts on student achievement (Morton et al., 2024; Thompson et al., 2023; Thompson &amp; Ward, 2022), health (Israel et al., 2020; Tomayko et al., 2020, 2021), and societal well-being (Fischer &amp; Argyle, 2018). Stakeholders also want to learn about the experience of implementing the 4DSW, such as satisfaction with the schedule change and district services available on the fifth “off day” (Kilburn et al., 2021). Given mixed and heterogeneous findings across 4DSW studies, stakeholders particularly want to use research evidence from studies most relevant to their specific educational contexts and informational needs. However, to date, no evidence synthesis has systematically identified and characterized empirical research studies on the 4DSW. The objective of this scoping review was therefore to examine the extent and types of published empirical research evidence available on the 4DSW at U.S. K-12 schools. Scoping reviews aim to explore and characterize the breadth of the published literature on a research topic (Peters et al., 2020; Tricco et al., 2018). Scoping reviews are particularly useful as a preliminary exercise in an emerging research area when it is still unclear whether more specific questions can be valuably addressed in future systematic reviews (Anderson et al., 2008). Consequently, this scoping review summarizes the types of empirical research evidence available for education stakeholders, assesses whether sufficient evidence exists for subsequent systematic reviews, and identifies existing gaps in the literature to inform future primary research. "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Eligibility Criteria 3.2 Information Sources 3.3 Search Strategy 3.4 Selection Process of Sources of Evidence 3.5 Data Charting Process and Items 3.6 Synthesis of Results", " 3 Methods We designed this study using the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis (Peters et al., 2020) and prospectively registered the review on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/xcthk). We drafted this manuscript using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for literature searches (Rethlefsen et al., 2021) and the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (Tricco et al., 2018). 3.1 Eligibility Criteria We included empirical studies examining 4DSWs at K-12 schools. We excluded studies focused on other alternative school schedules (e.g., extending the school year) that did not involve reducing traditional five-day school weeks to 4DSWs. Based on the interests of our research institute advisory board and stakeholders, we excluded studies in pre-school, postsecondary school, and countries other than the United States. The population of interest was any stakeholder considering the shift to a 4DSW. We included all research designs that involved the analysis of empirical data or simulated empirical data. We excluded conceptual papers, opinion articles, narrative literature reviews, and non-research sources (e.g., news). We included grey literature unless we could not obtain the full-text. Due to limitations in resources and language proficiency, we excluded studies published in languages other than English. 3.2 Information Sources We searched for eligible studies from May 2023 to April 2025 using the following electronic databases (with search platforms in parentheses): PubMed (National Library of Medicine), ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I (ProQuest), and Social Science Premium Collection (ProQuest). The Social Science Premium Collection includes the Criminology Collection, Education Collection (which includes Education Resources Information Center, or “ERIC”), International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Library &amp; Information Science Collection, Linguistics Collection, Politics Collection, Social Science Database, and Sociology Collection. To identify any further potentially eligible citations, we searched reference lists of included studies and citing references using citationchaser (Haddaway et al., 2022). We additionally hand-searched several key journals: Economics of Education Review, Education Finance and Policy, Journal of Education and Training Studies, Journal of School Health, and Rural Educator. We also looked for grey literature using Google Scholar. Although we did not contact authors nor search specific websites, we did add citations identified serendipitously (e.g., through social media). 3.3 Search Strategy A copy of the full search strategy is available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ryva8/). We developed the search strategy using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) Guideline (McGowan et al., 2016) and terms common in studies identified in a preliminary scan of the literature on Google Scholar. The search strategy did not involve the use of any published search filters. We uploaded the citations into a web-based systematic review data management software (DistillerSR) and used its “Duplicate Detection” function to search for duplicates prior to screening. 3.4 Selection Process of Sources of Evidence A copy of the selection process codebook is available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ryva8/). Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of each citation for potentially eligible studies. We retrieved full-texts for each citation deemed potentially eligible by at least one reviewer. Two review authors independently assessed each full-text for eligibility, recording reasons for excluding citations. Reviewers discussed initial disagreements of full-text eligibility decisions, meeting with a third reviewer as needed for unresolved disagreements. We used standardized forms in DistillerSR and did not blind review authors to journal titles, study authors, and authors’ institutions. 3.5 Data Charting Process and Items One PhD-level reviewer (SG), and either another graduate-level reviewer (KSF) or two undergraduate reviewers (a combination of BC, SH, and SM), independently collected data from each eligible article using DistillerSR. Reviewers resolved any disagreements through discussion, meeting with a third reviewer as needed for unresolved disagreements. We developed our data collection form through an iterative process—continually updating the items as data collection progressed and revisiting studies when new items were added to the form (Peters et al., 2020; Tricco et al., 2018). The form began with bibliographic items for author name, publication year, publication type (journal article, preprint, report, or student dissertation/thesis), and publisher (journal, preprint server, organization, or university). For student manuscripts, we collected information on degree level (doctoral, masters, or undergraduate) and discipline (economics, education, music, psychology, or sociology). The form then included items characterizing the source of evidence: i.e., years from which study data were collected, community types (rural, suburban, urban) and states in which the study took place, grade and school levels, student race/ethnicity, and any activities on the fifth “off day” officially offered by schools or districts. Because scoping reviews aim to characterize the extent and nature of existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, we did not critically appraise the included sources of evidence (Tricco et al., 2018). The data collection form concluded with items about the types of empirical evidence provided by included studies. Based on the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework for structuring policy and practice decision-making (Alonso-Coello et al., 2016), we assessed six types of empirical evidence: acceptability (extent to which the 4DSW is acceptable to specific stakeholder groups), effectiveness (impact of the 4DSW on student, school, and community outcomes), equity (degree to which the 4DSW has differential impacts by population and setting), feasibility (how the 4DSW was implemented), priority (focused on examining growth of schools, districts, or states adopting the 4DSW), and resource use (costs and resource implications of 4DSW adoption). 3.6 Synthesis of Results We narratively and visually summarized the study search and selection process via the number of records screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in our scoping review (Page et al., 2021; Tricco et al., 2018). We analyzed and summarized characteristics of the empirical research evidence through descriptive statistics. We present results through narrative and tabular summaries. "],["results.html", "4 Results 4.1 Characteristics of Sources of Evidence 4.2 Types of Empirical Research Evidence", " 4 Results Of 5,088 unique citations, we excluded 3,961 citations during title and abstract screening. Of the 552 remaining citations we could locate for full-text eligibility assessment, we excluded 375 citations. We included the remaining 133 studies (reported in manuscripts) in our scoping review (see Figure 1). 4.1 Characteristics of Sources of Evidence We provide a summary of characteristics of sources of evidence in Table 1. Included studies were published from 1980 to 2025 (median of 2018). Of the 133 studies, most (n = 102; 77%) are published in grey literature: 75 (56%) as a student dissertation or thesis, 19 (14%) as a student dissertation or thesis, and 8 (6%) as a preprint. Only 31 studies (23%) had a peer-reviewed journal article as the final version of record. Of the 75 student dissertation or thesis article types, 62 (83% of student manuscripts) were a doctoral dissertation, 11 (15%) were a masters thesis, and 2 (3%) were an undergraduate thesis. Most students completed dissertations and theses in partial fulfillment of degrees in education (n = 67; 89%), followed by economics (n = 4; 5%), psychology (n = 2; 3%), music (n = 1; 1%), and sociology (n = 1; 1%). Studies collected and analyzed data from 1975 to 2025 (median of 2012). Studies predominantly included data from rural communities in their sample (n = 97; 73%), though numerous studies also included data from urban (n = 39; 29%) and suburban communities in their samples (n = 36; 27%); 32 studies (24%) did not report information on community type. Studies included data from 35 states — most predominantly from Missouri (n = 40; 30%), Colorado (n = 29; 22%), Oklahoma (n = 18; 14%), Oregon (n = 18; 14%), New Mexico (n = 13; 10%), and South Dakota (n = 12; 9%). The number of studies providing data from elementary (n = 96; 72%), middle (n = 90; 68%), and high (n = 95; 71%) schools was fairly evenly distributed across levels, with data representing all grades (except kindergarten) included in at least half the studies. Most studies did not provide information on student race/ethnicity (n = 81; 61%) nor activities on the fifth “off day” officially offered by schools or districts (n = 79; 59%). 4.2 Types of Empirical Research Evidence We provide a summary of types of empirical research evidence in Table 2. Of the 133 included studies, most reported evidence on 4DSW effectiveness (n = 86; 65%). Among these 86 studies, 7 different methodological and statistical approaches were used: 23 studies used difference-in-differences (27% of effectiveness studies), 16 studies (19%) used descriptive statistics only, 15 (17%) studies used a before-after study design, 15 studies (17%) used a between-group (without controls) design, 7 studies (8%) used a between-group (with controls) design, 7 studies (8%) used a matched pair design, and 3 studies (4%) used a computational model design. These 86 studies provided outcome data across 9 domains: 55 studies (64% of effectiveness studies) reported on student achievement, 26 (30%) on student attendance, 16 (19%) on teacher and staff recruitment and retention, 9 (10%) on student attainment, 9 (10%) on student health status or behaviors, 7 (8%) on school climate, 6 (7%) on disciplinary incidents during school, 4 (5%) on household impacts, and 3 (4%) on juvenile crime. Most effectiveness studies (n = 45; 34% of effectiveness studies) also reported evidence on equity of 4DSW effects according to 10 domains: 28 (62% of equitability studies) on student age, 11 (24%) on community type or rurality, 11 (24%) on student socioeconomic status, 7 (16%) on student race or ethnicity, 5 (11%) on student gender identity or sex, 5 (11%) on student special education status, 3 (7%) on student English language learner status, 3 (7%) on gifted student status, and 1 (2%) on student immigration status. Of the 81 studies (61%) that reported one type of evidence on the implementability of the 4DSW, most (n = 50; 62% of studies with implementability data) reported evidence on acceptability. These 50 studies examined satisfaction with the 4DSW among teachers (n = 34; 68%), parents (n = 20; 40%), administrators (n = 18; 36%), students (n = 15; 30%), community members (n = 11; 22%), principals (n = 8; 16%), school staff (n = 8; 16%), superintendents (n = 8; 16%), athletics (n = 2; 4%), business owners (n = 2; 4%), counselors (n = 2; 4%), and school board members (n = 2; 4%). In addition, 41 studies (51% of studies with implementability data) reported evidence on feasibility of implementing the 4DSW, and 32 (40%) reported evidence on resource use associated with switching to a 4DSW. Lastly, only 6 studies (4% of all studies) reported evidence on 4DSW as a policy priority through an explicit empirical focus on the growth of schools, districts, or states adopting the 4DSW. "],["discussion.html", "5 Discussion", " 5 Discussion Our scoping review identified 133 studies published from1980 to 2025. Our findings indicate that empirical research evidence exists on the acceptability, effectiveness, equity, feasibility, priority, and resource use associated with 4DSW adoption across a range of states. Most studies reported evidence on 4DSW effects, though outcomes measured and rigor of the method used to assess effectiveness (and thus potential credibility of the evidence) vary considerably across these studies. In addition, more than half the studies examined at least one aspect of 4DSW implementability (i.e., acceptability, feasibility, or resource use). Strikingly, the vast majority of existing empirical research evidence is available only in the grey literature. To make this body of evidence more readily available to interested stakeholders, we created an online interactive bibliographic database that provides links to and information about each included study providing empirical research evidence on 4DSWs in the United States. Stakeholders can use this open access database to explore the diverse types of evidence available and find the studies most relevant to their specific contexts and sufficiently reliable for their evidence-informed decision-making needs. Given continued stakeholder interest in the 4DSW as an alternative school schedule, and the growing body of research on the 4DSW documented in this scoping review, there is clearly a need for future systematic reviews synthesizing the findings of empirical studies on the 4DSW. These reviews might assess the quality and rigor of available studies; estimate average and differential impacts on student, school, and community outcomes; and examine implementability of the 4DSW. That said, this current scoping review has already identified several key gaps in the existing evidence base that should be addressed in future primary research. For instance, although evidence from non-rural communities, on marginalized populations, and collected after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic does exist, the literature predominantly represents rural communities, is based on data collected prior to the pandemic, and does not examine equitability implications. In addition, future primary research should investigate and report information on student demographics, differential findings by various gradients of societal advantage, and activities offered on the fifth day. These additional primary studies and future systematic reviews can provide a range of education stakeholders with valuable evidence that can inform their decision-making around the tradeoffs associated with a shift to a 4DSW.
