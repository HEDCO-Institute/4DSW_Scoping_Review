The product will provide school districts with a resource to address their needs, questions, and concerns around all aspects of the transition to a four-day school week, including policy, community relations, human resources, scheduling, finances, and student achievement.    Over the past five years, weakening economic conditions have wreaked havoc across the country in most industries. Missouri public school districts have not been spared the hardship, as decreases in property tax subsidies and state budget shortfalls create lasting deficiencies in funding. With the passage of four-day school week/alternative calendar legislation, this economic crisis has spurred school districts in Missouri and across the nation to investigate options for an alternative calendar or four-day school week in order to reduce spending.    The need for an operations manual surfaced as the team examined four-day school week research and during the interviews of state department leaders from many states expressing limited guidance existed for districts investigating or making the transition to a four-day school week. District leaders considering this change have been forced to conduct their own research and develop an implementation plan without any guidance. As more and more districts consider this option, it will be beneficial for them to have a guide with the resources needed to implement the four-day school week. The purpose of this study was to identify what school leaders and policymakers need to know when considering or implementing a four-day school week.    An expert panel, consisting of school leaders and state education officials knowledgeable in educational policy and in the research and practice of school district administration reviewed the operations manual as part of the pilot. Following the expert panel review, the manual was refined based on recommendations and submitted to another expert panel for field test feedback. A complete evaluation of the final field-test recommendations and revisions were incorporated into the manual.","duplicate of 23","Initial RIS Import","Scoping Review Screening, Title & Abstract Screening",

Current research findings offer evidence that structuring time for student learning is an important factor in student achievement. School district superintendents are challenged with the issue of structuring time for optimal student learning and maintaining ideal transportation routes, school activities, and community support. The goal of this project was to determine if superintendents possess knowledge of structuring time for optimal student learning and apply those various strategies to effectively structure time in their districts’ school scheduling process.    Three strategies were identified to effectively structure time for optimal student learning through a review of literature. The strategies are: alternative calendars, start times, and flexibility for mastery within the daily schedule. The definition for each strategy was created through research in literature and review of an expert panel, which resulted in the definitions used in the project. A set of interview questions and an analysis instrument were developed for use during conversations with superintendents to determine the superintendents’ knowledge and application of structuring time for optimal student learning. The qualitative analysis of the superintendent interviews concluded even though each superintendent interviewed recognized some of the knowledge and research supporting structuring time for optimal student learning, none identified application of all strategies suggested by literature. Furthermore, other circumstances were recognized that seemed to affect superintendents’ application of structuring time for optimal student learning. Recommendations were made to superintendents. The goal of the recommendations was to improve the superintendents’ knowledge and application of structuring time for optimal student learning for future scheduling processes that occur at the district and building level.","duplicate of 138","Initial RIS Import","Scoping Review Screening, Title & Abstract Screening",

School Start Times and Middle Grade Students' Engagement and Achievement Outcomes in North Carolina","Purpose: We assess whether school start times predict the engagement and achievement outcomes of middle grades students. Our focus on middle grades is important because biological changes in sleep often begin when adolescents are in middle school and because middle school is a time when more students struggle academically. Research Methods/Approach: We use 6 years (2011-12 through 2016-17) of statewide administrative data from North Carolina to assess how school start times predict the school attendance, disciplinary records, and test scores of middle grades (6-8) students. We estimate a range of models--school fixed effect, student fixed effect, propensity score--and include a rich set of covariates to isolate the impact of start times. Findings: Our school engagement results are somewhat inconsistent but suggest that later start times predict a reduction in absences and suspensions. Later start times consistently predict higher test scores in mathematics and reading. Subgroup analyses return mixed results regarding which students benefit more from later middle school start times. Implications: Our results emphasize the broader connections between health and academic outcomes and indicate that policy makers should delay start times for middle grades students. States can instigate start time changes by incentivizing districts to delay or requiring that districts delay start times. Districts can independently delay their start times. In doing so, it is important that district officials take time to build support for the policy change and think comprehensively about the start times of all--elementary, middle, and high-district schools.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 192","Initial Full Search",,

The research question studied was what is the relationship between the four-day school week and teacher retention in rural school districts? Within the quantitative research design, the causal-comparative design was the selected procedure. The sample in this study was public educators teaching in rural public-school districts with a four-day school week as compared to teachers with a five-day school week from the state of Idaho. This data was collected in the Fall of 2021 into the Spring of 2022 from databases in the West and Midwest regions of the United States. Next, descriptive statistics were employed, including independent sample t-tests to investigate the discrepancies in teacher retention rates among rural public schools with four-day school weeks and those five-day school weeks by a variety of variables. The research compared teacher retention in rural school districts on the four-day school week to the rate of teacher retention in rural school districts on the five-day school week. Three years of historical teacher retention data was collected from the Idaho Department of Education beginning with the 2017-2018 school year and ending with the 2019-2020 school year. While results indicate that school districts on a five-day school week consistently had a higher rate of teacher retention when compared to districts on a four-day school week, there was no statistically significant impact (p>0.05).

This study examined associations of reduced school exposure via FDSWs with adolescent health and risk behaviors, obesity, and food security. Methods: Self-report data from 8th- and 11th-grade students from the Oregon Healthy Teens survey across 5 survey years (odd years 2007-2015, total N = 91,860-104,108 respondents depending on the survey question) were linked to a FDSW indicator. Regression analyses controlling for student and school characteristics compared outcomes between students in 4- and 5-day schools overall (without school fixed effects) and outcomes associated with switching to a FDSW (with school fixed effects). Results: When controlling for multiple student- and school-level factors, we observed adolescents in FDSW schools report they consume sugar sweetened beverages more frequently and water less frequently, have access to fewer days of physical education, are more likely to be food insecure, and are more likely to report the use of any drugs and specifically marijuana than 5-day school week students.

Implementation and Outcomes of the Four-Day School Week","The four-day school week (4dsw) is growing in popularity, especially in rural areas across the western United States. RAND Corporation researchers addressed knowledge gaps about the 4dsw by conducting a large-scale study of the implementation and outcomes of the 4dsw that involved the collection of original data in numerous districts across Idaho, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, as well as administrative data from these and other states. The researchers analyzed both qualitative and quantitative data to compare the 4dsw and five-day school week (5dsw). The analyses resulted in mixed findings. Advocates of the 4dsw argue that the shorter week saves money, improves student attendance, and helps recruit and retain teachers in rural districts. Cost savings related to the four-day model were relatively small, but savings due to a 4dsw may be used to maintain the level of instructional expenses in the face of revenue shortages. There was no quantitative evidence that the 4dsw improved student attendance. Qualitative data supported the view that the model helps attract and retain teachers. Families and students reported highly valuing the extra time that the 4dsw allowed them to spend together, and the data showed that, overall, stakeholders experienced high levels of satisfaction with the 4dsw. However, a comparison of English language arts and math test scores showed that students on the 4dsw have lower scores, over time, when compared with peers on a five-day schedule. Given these mixed findings, communities are likely to make different choices about the 4dsw depending on their goals and the local context.","duplicate of 93","Initial Full Search",,

Data from North Carolina, Wisconsin, Australia, England, and Israel covering almost 80 million person-days in school during 2020 help assess the magnitude of the fatality risks of in-person schooling, accounting for mitigation protocols as well as the age and living arrangements of students and teachers. The risks of in-person schooling to unvaccinated teachers are, for those not yet elderly, small enough to challenge comprehension. Valued at a VSL of $10 million, the average daily fatality cost ranges from $0.01 for a young teacher living alone to as much as $29 for an elderly teacher living with an elderly spouse. For each 22 million unvaccinated students and teachers schooling in-person for a 5-day week during the pandemic, the expected number of fatalities among teachers and their spouses is one or less.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 2942","Initial Full Search",,

[...]structuring the four-day school week to maintain adequate learning time seems to be the key to avoiding student learning loss and presents a path forward for schools considering this schedule. More to worry about than just achievement losses Lost exposure to the school environment doesn’t only mean missing in-person academic instruction, but also reduced access to school-meal programs, physical activity opportunities, and structured social interactions with peers, teachers, and administrators.

However, school calendars have remained stagnant and seemingly a product of society and economy, tied to agriculture, for over 100 years (Turner & Finch, 2018). In Missouri, a growing number of schools are reevaluating the five-day school week and implementing a four-day school week in response (Turner & Finch, 2018). As stated by Thompson (2020), the impact of the four-day school week on student achievement requires more study. This study involved investigating the impact of the four-day school week on student academic achievement by examining 7th-grade and 8th-grade MAP data provided by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in the areas of math and ELA prior to and following the implementation of the four-day school week. Additionally, the perceptions of principals and teachers who work within the four-day school were collected to examine teacher morale, school finance, student discipline, and overall attendance (teachers and students). Quantitative data were analyzed to investigate pre- and post-implementation patterns. Furthermore, qualitative data in the form of interview responses were analyzed using coding methods to identify common phrases, keywords, and themes. The study findings revealed the four-day school week produced a negative impact on 7th-grade ELA, according to MAP data analysis, whereas 7th-grade math, 8th-grade ELA, and 8th-grade math indicated an insignificant impact. Additionally, the perceptions of principals and teachers indicated the four-day school week was an overall benefit to the school climate.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 35","Initial Full Search",,

These schedules feature a day off once a week--often Friday--with increased time in school on each of the remaining four school days that, on average, is nearly an hour longer than the national average among five-day schools. Four-day school week schedules average only 148 school days per year, resulting in less time in school than the national average for five-day schools (180 days per year) despite the longer school days. Substantial heterogeneity exists in the structure of these schedules across states, which may help explain differential four-day school week effects on student outcomes across institutional settings in the previous literature.","duplicate of 51","Initial Full Search",,

Implementation and Outcomes of the Four-Day School Week. RR-A373-1","The four-day school week (4dsw) is growing in popularity, especially in rural areas across the western United States. RAND Corporation researchers addressed knowledge gaps about the 4dsw by conducting a large-scale study of the implementation and outcomes of the 4dsw that involved the collection of original data in numerous districts across Idaho, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, as well as administrative data from these and other states. The researchers analyzed both qualitative and quantitative data to compare the 4dsw and five-day school week (5dsw). The analyses resulted in mixed findings. Advocates of the 4dsw argue that the shorter week saves money, improves student attendance, and helps recruit and retain teachers in rural districts. Cost savings related to the four-day model were relatively small, but savings due to a 4dsw may be used to maintain the level of instructional expenses in the face of revenue shortages. There was no quantitative evidence that the 4dsw improved student attendance. Qualitative data supported the view that the model helps attract and retain teachers. Families and students reported highly valuing the extra time that the 4dsw allowed them to spend together, and the data showed that, overall, stakeholders experienced high levels of satisfaction with the 4dsw. However, a comparison of English language arts and math test scores showed that students on the 4dsw have lower scores, over time, when compared with peers on a five-day schedule. Given these mixed findings, communities are likely to make different choices about the 4dsw depending on their goals and the local context. [For the research brief, see ED615238.

This study collected comparative data of the five-day school week to the four-day school week. The archival data of student attendance rates and discipline incident rates were from districts with the adopted four-day calendar from the years 2012-2018. The goal of this study was to add to the body of existing knowledge regarding the impact of the four-day school week on students. The purpose of this two-way repeated measures of ANOVA quantitative study was to analyze the transition of Missouri four-day public school districts and determine if the four-day school week impacted student attendance and student discipline incidents. The quantitative research found the four-day school week does not significantly impact student attendance or student discipline incident rates. Implications for policy and practice included researching the variety of ways to implement a compressed school and workweek and creating an action plan to track school district data, including student attendance and student discipline incidents, because the success of the four-day school week depends on the school community.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3046","Initial Full Search",,

In addition, the purpose of this study was to further investigate district leaders reasoning of making the move to the four-day school week schedule and their perceptions. Plus, there was inquiry to validate if teacher’s perceptions were mostly positive or negative in regard to teaching reading, teacher collaboration and student reading achievement utilizing the four-day school week schedule. For the student data portion of the study, there were nine independent sample t tests administered between 13 four-day and demographically matched five-day school districts to determine if there were any significant differences between 3rd through 5th grade students MAP reading proficiency mean scores from 2017 to 2019. The results of the t tests indicated there were no significant differences in reading proficiency mean scores between any of the matched four-day and five-day school districts. There were 31 superintendent surveys gathered which indicated that the main reason for moving to the four-day week schedule was to recruit and retain quality teachers and the consensus to continue with the four-day week schedule was unanimous. There were 55 teacher survey responses collected which stated teacher’s perceptions of the four-day school week had an overall positive impact on the amount of reading instruction time, teacher collaboration, and altogether student reading achievement. The findings of this study have implications for rural school district leaders, staff, and communities that are interested in switching from a five-day to the four-day school week. Also, rural school district leaders and communities should consider the findings of this study in regard to teacher recruitment and retention, teacher collaboration opportunities, and elementary student reading achievement. Recommendations for further research could include a larger sample size of student data by adding 6th grade through 12th grade comparisons of reading proficiency scores between four-day and five-day school week districts. It is recommended that further survey research could be conducted through a qualitative study with more detailed survey questions to superintendent and staff by means of short answer response.","duplicate of 59","Initial Full Search",,

A 28 question online survey was administered using mixed item types (Likert-type, multiple choice and open-ended) to music educators from across the United States who are representative of school districts in all educational settings (i.e., rural, semi-rural, suburban and urban).Section I (questions 1-8) collected music educators and program demographic data to determine if they comprise a representative sample. Questions 9-13 discussed the personal impact the schedule has had on the music teacher, their opinions on it and their personal perception of the schedule. Next, questions 14-16 reviewed how the transition to the four-day work week has affected the instruction and preparation for the music classroom. Lastly, questions 17-19 addressed the impact the modified schedule has had on student participation and success. The final question (20), was an open ended answer that allows band directors to leave any important information that they think the researcher should know.The results of the survey found that the frequency of instruction and decrease in instructional time creates limitations on curriculum, ensembles and concert literature. However, many teachers found the schedule to have personal benefits. Music programs must in turn adapt to the circumstances in creative ways to engage students on a consistent basis. The findings also showed that to be successful on the shortened schedule, results indicated that educators must maintain high levels of student’s engagement, adjusting repertoire to fit the realities of less instructional time, extra review time and by having a strong student assessment system in place. The implications of the four-day school week on school music programs are discussed fully in the final chapter.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 62","Initial Full Search",,

Between 2009 and 2015, 27 Idaho school districts transitioned to a four-day school week, bringing the total number of school districts on a four-day week to 44 by 2015. This number increased to 45 by 2018. As school districts have become more comfortable with the four-day week schedule, school employees and constituents alike have increased satisfaction. A four-day school week results in about 20% fewer days of student and teacher contact days. This leads to a concern of how a four-day school week impacts academic performance. The purpose of this quantitative research study was to look at student achievement scores, specifically in Idaho rural public schools. The research compared standardized test scores of rural school districts on the four-day school week to the same test scores of rural school districts on the five-day school week. Additionally, sub populations with similar demographics were analyzed. These demographics included economically disadvantaged (free and reduced lunch percentages) and the percentage of Hispanics/Latinos. School districts that had an economically disadvantaged population of at least 45% were also analyzed. Five years of historical standardized test scores were gathered from the Idaho Department of Education beginning with the 2014-2015 school year and ending with the 2018-2019 school year. The standardized test scores that were analyzed included the Idaho Reading Indicator (IRI) and the Idaho Standards Achievement Test (ISAT). While results indicate that school districts on a five-day school week consistently had a higher percentage of proficient/advanced students on standardized tests when compared to four-day week school districts, there was no statistically significant impact (p≥.05) on the academic performance, as determined by the previously mentioned standardized metrics. Only one year (instead of five years) of the Hispanic/Latino sub population was able to be compared because of the significant redactions that took place in order to be compliant with privacy laws.","duplicate of 31","Initial Full Search",,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible effects of the four-day school week model on teacher attraction and retention in a rural school district in Missouri. The researcher conducted interviews with seven principals of schools that had adopted the model. He also deployed a survey consisting of closed- and open-ended questions to collect the opinions of respondents working at those seven schools. Additionally, he retrieved assessment data from the state’s public education website. First, the researcher collected data from the human resources department about teacher retention rates and the number of applicants who applied for teaching positions in the district for a period of three year prior to becoming a four-day school week district. Second, the researcher sent out anonymous surveys to all teachers in the school district to collect information from open-ended questions about the reasons they either joined or stayed with a four-day school district. Lastly, the researcher collected data from the human resources department about teacher retention rates and the number of applicants who applied for teaching positions in the district for each school year since implementing the four-day school week. Secondary data was analyzed to determine if MAP scores were affected by the four-day school week.

This collective case study was undertaken to examine the perceptions of administrators, school counselors, and teachers on the four-day school week and the impact of the new calendar format on teacher recruitment, teacher retention, and job satisfaction. Three school districts were studied; each began implementation of the four-day school week during the 2015-2016 academic year. A total of 21 school personnel were interviewed, including three superintendents, three building administrators, three school counselors, and 12 teachers. Participants overwhelmingly identified the four-day school week as a benefit to them personally, citing the ability to balance work and family as positive. Employees of two of the three school districts reported improved ability to recruit potential candidates for teaching positions. Educators from all three districts reported an improvement in teacher retention, as the four-day schedule is very popular with teachers. Also noted as valuable and important to the teaching staff is the additional time for professional development and collaboration built into the school calendar. Given the difficulties small rural school districts frequently face when securing and retaining a highly qualified teaching staff, the findings of this study point to an unintended, yet powerful outcome of implementation of the four-day school week--the ability to recruit and retain teachers.

The purpose of this quantitative study was to identify the relationship between student test scores from a five-day school week and student test scores from a four-day school week. This study also sought to identify the relationship between student attendance rates for students attending a five-day school week and attendance rates for students attending a four-day school week. Student ACT composite test scores and attendance rates were acquired using statistical information gathered by the state's department of education's website annually. Student ACT composite scores compiled prior to the move to a four day school week were compared to the ACT composite scores compiled during the years the same school followed a traditional five-day school week. School student attendance rates compiled prior to the move to a four day school week were compared to the school student attendance rates compiled during the years the same school followed a traditional five-day school week. Dependent t-tests of reliability were used along with Cohen's d strength tests to compare student ACT Composite test scores and attendance rates before and after the conversion to four-day school weeks. The results of this study show test result and student attendance downward trends that may be worthwhile studying in the future when more examples and more data become available. When the attendance rates of the schools in this study that converted to a four-day school week were averaged together, the attendance rates of the schools in this study went down .13 percent. This was not found to be a significant difference. The ACT Composite test scores of the schools in this study, when averaged together, went down an average of .49 points which was found to be an insignificant difference despite two outlier schools whose scores went down over two points on average. The conversion to a four-day school week may or may not be deemed successful due to the increase in attendance for the schools involved depending on the goal of the school and whether they believe less than half of a point in test score drops is too significant compared to the maximum increase in attendance of 7.9 percent.

Research Questions 1 through 3 addressed district performance including teacher/staff and student attendance, achievement on the state assessment in reading and math, and costs on utilities. Research Question 4 addressed stakeholder perception. Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and collective impact theory served as the foundation for this study. The purposive sample included 40 internal and external stakeholders. Data collected included archival documents, semistructured interviews, and a structured questionnaire. A quantitative trend analysis was conducted on archival documents. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on interview perception data and structured questionnaire data was recoded for frequency. Archival data revealed natural gas costs decreased, student attendance improved, teacher/staff attendance declined, math scores dropped, reading scores were flat, and water/electricity costs increased. Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district.

In recent years, some schools have come under financial burdens associated with poor test scores that correlate with funding under legislation. These financial burdens have impacted rural school districts that allocate up to 5% of their budget to transportation. Some schools seek to alleviate these burdens by implementing nontraditional schedules. Among these schedules, the 4-day week has become increasingly popular since the 1970’s. Research on the 4-day week has primarily been focused on its impact on financial saving and student achievement. School culture is an important factor in any school building as it impacts teacher satisfaction and student achievement. The researcher sought to understand teachers’ perceptions of the impact of a 4-day week on school culture as little research had been done in this area. The researcher used Steve Grunert’s School Culture Survey (SCS) as a quantitative tool to collect data from participants utilizing a 4-day school week and participants in similar schools utilizing a 5-day school week in Oklahoma. This tool can be divided into 6 categories that promote a positive, collaborative culture: collaborative leadership, teacher collaboration, professional development, unity of purpose, collegial support, and learning partnership. The data from the SCS showed statistical significance in the areas of collaborative leadership, teacher collaboration, and learning partnership.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 42","Initial Full Search",,
426,"Lewis, Michael E.","Comparing Professional Learning Practices of Missouri's Four and Five Day Schools","The role of quality professional learning for teachers has become a top priority due to legislative changes including the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Research has shown a lack of dedicated time is among the issues that hinder effective professional learning. While the four-day school week is typically used to address budget issues for rural schools, the schedule’s flexibility may be uniquely able to aid professional learning efforts. The purpose of this study was to determine the differences between professional learning practices in Missouri’s four- and five-day schools. The Standards for Professional Learning, created by Learning Forward, served as the theoretical framework. The researcher obtained permission from Learning Forward to collect data using the organization’s Standards Assessment Inventory (SAI) survey instrument. Teachers from 18 Missouri four-day schools and 21 comparable five-day schools based on size, RPDC region, and free and reduced lunch population were included in the study. The teachers responded via online survey distributed by email. Statistical analysis included independent sample two-tailed t-tests adjusted for unequal sample sizes at the p < 0.05 level. Missouri four-day teachers rated the Learning Communities, Leadership, and Data standards significantly higher than their five-day counterparts did. The findings of this study add to the sparse body of literature related to the four-day school week and professional learning practices. The study concluded that the four-day school week may help schools improve professional learning practices due to the unique availability of professional development time on the off-day.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 89","Initial Full Search",,

The four-day school week has been credited with producing a number of potential benefits and consequences, but there is currently a limited amount of research available to determine the overall worth of the practice compared to the five-day school week. Some purported impacts of the four-day school week include shifts in teacher and student attendance, changes in achievement, financial adjustments, decreases in dropout rates, and improvement in morale (Plucker, Cierniak, & Chamberlin, 2012). This study involved investigating the system-wide impact of the four-day school week by examining attendance, ACT scores, and dropout rates before and after implementation in participating school districts across Missouri. Additionally, the school climate perceptions of Missouri administrators and teachers who work within the four-day school week were collected. Interview responses were then analyzed using coding methods to identify common phrases, key words, and themes, while the quantitative data were treated to examine pre- and post-implementation patterns. The findings of this study revealed the four-day school week produced a statistically positive significant impact on attendance, whereas ACT scores and dropout rates were not influenced. Furthermore, the perceptions of administrators and teachers indicated the four-day school week was beneficial to the school culture.

This article examines the impact on employees using a postimplementation survey. For employees on the 4-day schedule, there were no significant differences by gender on work-family balance or on the impact of the schedule. However, women did demonstrate slightly more positive attitudes toward the 4-day schedule. Employees with children at home reported lower work-family balance and greater impact of the 4-day schedule. In contrast, no difference in attitudes toward the 4-day schedule was found by age, although work-family balance differed among age groups. There were differences in work-family balance between employees on the 4-day schedule and those on traditional schedules; however, the more substantial factor was whether an employee selected his or her schedule. The current study highlights the importance of engaging employees when making significant organizational changes, such as transitioning from traditional work schedules to alternative schedules.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3047","Initial Full Search",,

Research has shown the beneficial and adverse aspects of an alternative school calendar through monetary interest, attendance of students and staff, morale, and academic scores (Donis-Keller & Silvernail 2009). However, there is limited information regarding the influence shortened school weeks have on students’ social choices, particularly the choices they make with activities on weekends.   As a result of lengthened weekends, the purpose of this case study was to examine the perception four-day school weeks has left on the various stakeholders of a rural Montana high school, with an emphasis on extended weekends, and to investigate the specific activities high school students participate in during three-day weekends. In order to investigate this topic further, the following research questions were directed to stakeholders from a rural Montana school district that recently shifted to a four-day schedule: 1.) As a result of a four-day school week, how do rural school stakeholders view the choices made by students on extended weekends?; 2.)What choices do students make on their extended weekends, and, according to stakeholders, what influences those choices?; 3.) In what ways is the four-day school week contributing to or detracting from student well-being? Data collection was achieved through individual interviews of administrators, teachers, and coaches, a focus group was held with parents of high school students, and insight from senior students was collected through a text-messaging system called Remind. Remind provided an innovative data collection technique that maintained anonymity of adolescent participants. The findings of this case study emphasize the importance and advancement in adolescent involvement with extracurricular activities, workforce, time spent with family and peers, and religious practices. However, the findings also bring forth further questions about adolescents not involved in athletics, clubs, religious endeavors, and the workforce.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 37","Initial Full Search",,

Initially a cost-saving measure, school leaders hoped that the move to an amended calendar would not compromise the quality of education that students receive in the system. This study examines student achievement data from eighth-graders in the pseudonymous Rockbridge County Schools to determine if there was any change in student performance after the changed calendar structure. Using reading and math scores from Georgia’s standardized summative assessment, this study compares historical student achievement data on the traditional five-day school week to achievement data on the four-day school week over a six-year period. Data from students with disabilities were also compared and examined separately to determine if there was a disproportionate change in performance for this subgroup. The researcher found no significant difference in student achievement for any Rockbridge County students (including those students with disabilities), and student performance actually increased after the change to the amended calendar.

506,"Lauterstein, Dana","Early Life Exposure to E-cigarettes Induces CNS Modifications Associated with Adverse Neurobiological and Neurobehavioral Outcomes","Early life exposure to cigarette smoke is associated with adverse neurocognitive and neurobehavioral outcomes including decreases in general intellectual ability, development of conduct disorders, and increased hyperactivity-impulsivity behaviors. While there have been major declines in conventional cigarette usage over the past decade, recent epidemiological data indicate that the popularity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), and consequently nicotine use, is rising in both adolescent and adult populations on a global scale. As nicotine is a known developmental neurotoxin, these products present a potential threat for the developing central nervous system (CNS). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether developmental neurotoxicity and later life behavioral changes associated with early life exposure to cigarette smoke are also affected by early life exposure to e-cigarette aerosols. This study also investigated if nicotine was the primary e-cigarette component inducing adverse effects, or if other constituents emitted from e-cigarettes could produce neurotoxicity. To accomplish this pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed daily (by whole body inhalation) throughout gestation (3 hr/day; 5 day/week) to aerosols produced from e-cigarettes either with (13–16 mg/mL) or without nicotine; following birth, pups and dams were exposed together to e-cigarette aerosols throughout lactation beginning at postnatal day (PND) 4–6 using the same exposure conditions employed during prenatal exposure. Following exposure cessation, a subset of female and male juvenile offspring (1-mo-of-age) was evaluated for transcriptome changes (via RNA-sequencing) in the frontal cortex, as well as selected gene expression changes (via qRT-PCR) and markers of neuroinflammation (via fluorescent microscopy) in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus. In adulthood another subset of female and male offspring (4-mo-of-age) were tested for persistence of gene expression changes in the same brain regions, as well as for behavioral outcomes.     Frontal cortex transcriptome sequencing revealed that e-cigarettes, both with and without nicotine, induced sex-dependent gene expression changes associated with predicted adverse neurobiological and neurobehavioral outcomes. In addition, a greater number of significant gene expression changes were observed in offspring exposed to e-cigarette aerosols without nicotine compared to those exposed to nicotine-containing aerosols. Persistence of gene expression alterations for selected genes examined in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of 1-mo- and 4-mo-old offspring revealed variations based on brain region, sex, and e-cigarette aerosol treatment type (i.e., with or without nicotine). Results from microscopy studies indicated that only offspring exposed to e-cigarette aerosols without nicotine early in life exhibited enhanced expression of Iba-1, a specific marker of microglia, in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Lastly, behavioral analyses demonstrated significant locomotor activity increases in adult offspring exposed to both e-cigarette aerosols with and without nicotine early in life.     Overall, results indicate that exposure to e-cigarette aerosols, with and without nicotine, pose a considerable risk to the developing CNS. Additionally, nicotine does not appear to be the driving factor for the examined biological effects, as similar or more extensive effects were seen in offspring exposed to e-cigarette aerosols without nicotine for all parameters (when compared to offspring exposed to e-cigarette aerosols that contained nicotine). These results contribute to the limited toxicological database on e-cigarettes and emphasize the need for studies examining early life exposure to these products and development of later life disease.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3048","Initial Full Search",,

School districts are facing difficulties in maximizing education while operating on a tight budget. The purpose of this mixed-method study is to evaluate the financial impact of going to a four-day school week and to explore the perceptions of employee morale. The significance of this study may give insight to educational leaders on alternative ways to utilize school calendars more efficiently.    The quantitative research question for this study was, What impact does the four-day week have on school districts’ yearly financial expenditures? The null hypothesis was, The four-day week will have no impact on the districts’ yearly financial expenditures. The alternative hypothesis was, The four-day week will have a significant impact on the districts’ yearly financial expenditures with a significant decrease in the amount of money spent. To address this research question the researcher chose all school districts in the state of Missouri that operated on a four-day week schedule for 2014–2015. The ADA expenditures for the first year the selected districts went to the four-day week schedule and the last year the selected districts were on the five-day week schedules were the two dependent variables collected. The p-value from the paired t-test conducted was 0.416; therefore, the researcher would retain the (Ho).      The qualitative research question of this study was, What are administrators,’ teachers,’ and support staff’s perception of the morale of the other employees within the four-day school week district? To address this research question the researcher chose to do a case study on a school district in the state of Missouri that operates on a four-day week schedule.

We use school-level data from Colorado to investigate the relationship between the four-day week and academic performance among elementary school students.

While some schools have continued with this alternative scheduling option, more school districts are taking a renewed interest in this option as a way to curtail shrinking budgets and increasing transportation expenses. This study examined the perceptions of the implementation of the four-day school week in one rural Missouri school district through three pivotal points in time. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological case study was to examine the perceptions of the parents, teachers, administrators, support staff, and community members regarding the four-day school week at the initial decision, once the new schedule began, and after two years of implementing the four-day school week. The researcher anticipated the knowledge garnered from this case study would provide valuable information that the participating district would find useful to improve its existing four-day school week and that other schools might find useful while deciding if implementing a four-day school week is right for their district. This case study examined certain perceptions regarding the four-day school week, including student academic achievement, absenteeism in students and staff, and morale of students and staff, as well as any other issues the participants felt compelled to share. The study used an online survey with a Likert scale, as well as a questionnaire containing open-ended questions. The overwhelming majority of respondents felt that the four-day school week had improved student academic success, reduced absenteeism, and enhanced overall morale. However, several parents did note some other concerns that this school and others should regard as genuine concerns.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3037","Initial Full Search",,
540,"Fischer, Stefanie Jane","Essays on Human and Social Capital Accumulation","This dissertation consists of three essays in applied microeconomics that address topics of human and social capital accumulation. The first essay addresses the topic of women and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math.) Women are substantially less likely than men to graduate college with a STEM degree. This paper investigates whether class composition can help explain why women are disproportionately more likely to fall out of the STEM ""pipeline''. Identification comes from a standardized enrollment process at a large public university that randomly assigns freshmen to different mandatory introductory chemistry lectures. Using administrative data, I find that women who are enrolled in a class with higher ability peers are less likely to graduate with a STEM degree, while men's persistence in STEM is unaffected by class composition. I also show that the decline for women is most pronounced for those in the bottom third of the ability distribution. I rule out the possibility that this is driven solely by grades because both men and women receive higher grades in classes with higher ability peers. Overall, these results suggest that class composition as an important factor in determining STEM persistence for women and provide a novel explanation for part of the STEM gender gap in post-secondary education.   The second essay, co-authored with Daniel Argyle, examines the effect of the four-day school week in rural Colorado on juvenile crimes. Four-day school weeks are becoming more common nationwide especially in rural areas. Those affected by the policy spend the same number of hours in school each week as students on a typical five-day week, however the four-day week schedule essentially reallocates unstructured time into larger blocks creating a three-day weekend every weekend, since treated students for the most part have Fridays off. Our difference-in-difference estimates for rural Colorado indicate that switching all students in a county from a five-day week to a four-day week increases juvenile arrests for property crimes, in particular larceny, by about 80%.   In the third essay, co-authored with Christiana Stoddard, we study the academic achievement of American Indians. The academic achievement of American Indians has not been extensively studied. Using NAEP supplements, we find that the average achievement relative to white students resembles other disadvantaged groups. However, there are several differences. Family characteristics explain two times as much of the raw gap as for blacks. School factors also account for a larger portion of the gap than for blacks or Hispanics. The distribution is also strikingly different: low performing American Indian students have a substantially larger gap than high performing students. Finally, racial self-identification is more strongly related to achievement, especially as American Indian students age.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 151","Initial Full Search",,

In recent years, studies have focused on the instructional benefits of making the switch from a five-day to four-day school week.   Effective use of time as an instructional resource plays a meaningful role in educational leadership activities of school district superintendents.       This multisite case study sought to describe the perceptions of 10 South Dakota superintendents employed in school districts using a four-day calendar regarding the quality of their professional development programs.  Data were collected using a semi-structured interview based on the McREL Professional Development Audit.  Additional data gathered by the researcher included school district demographics, professional development planning documents, school calendars, and district websites.     Superintendents believed the four-day school week calendar provided the time to make a positive impact on the vision and goals, planning, design, resources, and evaluation components of a high quality professional development program.  The study supported current research that district planners should provide professional development time that is organized, structured, and purposefully driven.  Common themes among respondents included (a) articulate and set as a strategic goal during the calendar adoption process the importance of implementing a high quality professional development program for teachers and set specific dates within the calendar assigned for professional development (b) incorporate student remedial activities into the calendar (c) provide fiscal resources to support the professional development program, and (d)  demonstrate effective administrative leadership to ensure fidelity in the design and implementation of the district's professional development program.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3019","Initial Full Search",,

The MontCAS is the standardized assessment in reading, mathematics, and science adopted by the Montana Office of Public Instruction as a result of mandates from the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.    In the spring of 2005, the Montana Legislature approved changes to the accreditation standards in Montana by allowing a school to be accredited based upon a total number of contact hours instead of the previous requirement of a minimum number of contact hours and a minimum number of days of instruction. Ten schools made the conversion to a four day week beginning in the 2006-2007 school year. By 2008-2009 there were 22 schools following a four day week calendar and over the next several years, this number doubled every two years. By the 2012-2013 school year, there were over 100 schools in Montana with a four day week.    Data was provided by the Montana Office of Public Instruction on every student from every school in Montana that utilized the four day school week from implementation through the 2012-2013 school year. This data was analyzed by cohort based upon the year of implementation of the four day week in addition to being considered in the composite as the number of students tested in schools with the four day week grew from just over 200 in the spring of 2007 to 2685 in the spring of 2013.    The total percentage of students identified as proficient and advanced was compared to state-wide averages disaggregated by cohort and in composite over the academic years of 2006-2007 through 2012-2013.

The researcher interviewed eight of the high school teachers who met the inclusion criteria regarding experience with both the four- and five-day school schedule. The focus of the study was on the qualitative data, with aggregate quantitative data regarding student and teacher attendance and ISAT scores collected from the District through the State's Department of Education website, used to explicate the qualitative findings. The overall feeling among interviewees regarding attendance of both students and teachers was that it either improved permanently, improved temporarily, or there was no change. All eight interviewees felt that at worst there had been no change, or that student achievement improved with the move to the four-day school week schedule. The researcher also included teacher perceptions regarding other areas such as schedule transition, teacher morale, use of instructional time, teacher planning and collaboration, and professional development. The interviewees felt pleased with their school's transition to a four-day school week schedule and felt that teacher morale had improved with the change. It was perceived that the four-day week allowed for more quality instructional time, with more time to plan and coordinate lesson plans. While the quantitative data trends implied student achievement fluctuation more so than strong positive achievement gains, like the qualitative findings, negative or downward trends were not evidenced. These findings contribute to the overall empirical body of knowledge regarding the four-day school week schedule.

601,"Cardinale, Nelly","Examining the transition to a four-day school week and investigating post-change faculty/staff work-life balance: A community college case study","This single descriptive embedded case study examined the process of implementing a four-day work/school week at a community college and investigated post-change faculty/staff work-life balance. All of the students attending this college live at home. The change was implemented due to state funding shortfalls, increasing college utility expenses and low employee morale. Additionally, this study resulted in a set of guidelines that can be used by change agents of similar colleges to implement this change. Moreover, the study describes the positive and negative aspects associated with the shorter work/school week. On a positive note, the schedule facilitates making personal appointments, volunteer work, improves work-life balance, provides longer more restful weekends, increases employee morale, productivity, performance, and reduces commuting expenses. On a negative note, the schedule requires employees to work longer days, increases daily work-related stress, reduces weekday family time and creates work/daycare schedule conflicts. Furthermore, the study found that faculty/staff work-life balance improved the most for employees ages 25-44. The study recommends that college leaders interested in implementing the same change create an alternative four-day work schedule for essential weekend employees in order to provide them similar work-life balance benefits. Most importantly, college leaders should work with human resources officials to create flexible working hours and telecommuting policies to implement along with this schedule. Finally, administrators should assure that employees do not work longer than nine hours per day to prevent burnout, work with employees to solve work/daycare schedule conflicts and that all college stakeholders participate in the change process.","duplicate of 26","Initial Full Search",,
602,"Carter, Gregory, Hull, Lisa Suzanne, Odneal, Becky, Roling, Tim","The school leader and policymaker's guide to a four-day school week: Considerations, implementation, tools, and best practice","This product development report addresses the components for an operations manual, which will serve as a guide for school districts pursuing or implementing a four-day school week. The product will provide school districts with a resource to address their needs, questions, and concerns around all aspects of the transition to a four-day school week, including policy, community relations, human resources, scheduling, finances, and student achievement.     Over the past five years, weakening economic conditions have wreaked havoc across the country in most industries. Missouri public school districts have not been spared the hardship, as decreases in property tax subsidies and state budget shortfalls create lasting deficiencies in funding. With the passage of four-day school week/alternative calendar legislation, this economic crisis has spurred school districts in Missouri and across the nation to investigate options for an alternative calendar or four-day school week in order to reduce spending.     The need for an operations manual surfaced as the team examined four-day school week research and during the interviews of state department leaders from many states expressing limited guidance existed for districts investigating or making the transition to a four-day school week. District leaders considering this change have been forced to conduct their own research and develop an implementation plan without any guidance. As more and more districts consider this option, it will be beneficial for them to have a guide with the resources needed to implement the four-day school week. The purpose of this study was to identify what school leaders and policymakers need to know when considering or implementing a four-day school week.     An expert panel, consisting of school leaders and state education officials knowledgeable in educational policy and in the research and practice of school district administration reviewed the operations manual as part of the pilot. Following the expert panel review, the manual was refined based on recommendations and submitted to another expert panel for field test feedback. A complete evaluation of the final field-test recommendations and revisions were incorporated into the manual.","duplicate of 23","Initial Full Search",,

This study exploits this empirical regularity and the essentially random variation between students in the ordering of classes over the day to measure how the returns to classroom learning vary by course subject, and how much attendance in one class spills over into learning in other subjects. We find that having a class in first period significantly reduces grades in that course but does not affect grades in related subjects. We also find that having math in first period reduces test scores in all subjects and reduces grades in future math classes. These effects are particularly large for black students. For classes other than math, we find little effect of having the class in first period on test scores or long-term grades. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","duplicate of 613","Initial Full Search",,

The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to determine what the job satisfaction was for teachers and administrators whose schools had changed from the 5-day school week to the 4-day school week; (b) document a relationship between changing from the 5-day school week to the 4-day school and teacher, administrator, and student attendance. A total of 183 teachers and 11 administrators from the school district were surveyed using the Teacher Job Satisfaction Questionnaire (TJSQ) (Lester, 1982). The analysis of the data revealed that the job satisfaction of teachers and administrators was positive following the change from the 5-day school week to the 4-day school week. The analysis of the attendance data showed a decrease in the number of absences of teachers, administrators and students after changing from the 5-day school week to the 4-day day school week.

679,"Dixon, Asenith","""Focus"" on the Alternative School Calendar: Year-Round School Programs and Update on the Four-Day School Week. Challenge to Lead","In recent years, lean economic conditions have led to state and local agency budget cuts, including reductions to elementary and secondary education. To compensate for less state funding and decreasing local revenues, many state legislatures have passed policy and funding bills that give school systems more latitude in making finance and program decisions. A key area where more flexibility is apparent is the scheduling of school calendars. One of the first responses to the downturn in the economy was to explore the four-day school week as a money-saving measure. Statutes in nearly half of the 16 SREB (Southern Regional Education Board) states now permit local school districts to adopt calendars where students attend school for longer but fewer days. With renewed focus at the state and federal level on reforming education and increasing student learning, state policy-makers also are looking for more creative ways to arrange the instructional school year. The concept of altering the traditional school calendar is not new, but few schools and districts across the country have embraced the idea. Those that have chosen alternative calendars typically have similar reasons, including raising student achievement, reducing the achievement gap among groups of students, saving money, and decreasing school overcrowding. In the SREB region, most schools and districts that operate on an alternative calendar use either a year-round school program or a four-day school week, although year-round schedules are more prevalent. Year-round school calendars reorganize minimum instructional time requirements across the school year; reduce the time students spend on summer vacation; and provide multiple opportunities for tutoring, remediation and enrichment throughout the school year. This ""Focus"" report provides an overview of year-round programs and examines the advantages and challenges that are inherent to most, if not all, of these programs. It also provides an update on actions relating to the four-day school week. Although only a small percentage of schools in the SREB region have year-round programs in operation, it is important for education leaders and legislators to explore whether this type of calendar contributes to stronger academic achievement results for students.

This study investigated how achievement tests scores of schools with a four-day school week compared with schools with a traditional five-day school week. The study focused on student performance in Colorado where 62 school districts operated a four-day school week. The results of the Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) were utilized to examine student performance in reading, writing, and mathematics in grades 3 through 10. While the mean test scores for five-day week schools exceeded those of four-day week schools in 11 of the 12 test comparisons, the differences were slight, with only one area revealing a statistically significant difference. This study concludes that decisions to change to the four-day week should be for reasons other than student academic performance.

The discussion of a four-day school week is being considered as many school districts try to balance their budgets each school year.  Some schools in the past 30 years have begun changing to a four-day school week.  The four-day school week can create controversy within a community, concerns among parents and students, and benefits for the school district as well as for parents and students.  The researcher studied one rural school district transitioning from a five-day school week to a four-day school week.  The purpose of the study was to identify what made a rural school district decide to transition to a four-day school week, how the school district accomplished this new delivery of PK-12 education, and to identify perceptions regarding this transition.     The case study was completed with one rural Minnesota school district.  The researcher conducted on-site interviews with school administration and one school board member, and gathered school district data from the past three years to review and identify how the school district changed to a four-day school week.       The results from the data collected indicated the school district transitioned to a four-day school week because of financial reasons.  The school district did not want to reduce educational opportunities for students by eliminating class offerings or cutting teaching positions.  The data indicated, after experiencing the four-day school week, most students, parents, and teachers favored the new four-day school week compared to the previous five-day school week.  The main concerns identified by the participants and data reviewed were younger students adapting to the longer school day, extracurricular adjustments, upset classified personnel, how much money would the district save, and tired employees at the end of the four-day week.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3029","Initial Full Search",,

Improving student achievement has been the focus of school reforms regarding time, including the 4-day school schedule, block scheduling, year-round schools, and expanded learning time. This study looked at schools in the state of Colorado that have participated in the 4-day school schedule during the school years 2005–2008 and found that there were no effects of the 4-day school schedule on 3rdgrade reading, writing, and math scores compared to those scores in comparably sized schools operating on a more traditional 5-day schedule. In addition, there is no relationship between 3rd-grade Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) assessments for 3rd-grade students on a 4-day or 5-day schedule. According to the study, 3rd-grade students attending a 4-day school week scored better than or equal to the state CSAP percentage proficient and above for 2005–2008. Quantitative research methods were used, data were collected, and the analysis added research to the effects of time on achievement.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3053","Initial Full Search",,

According to a new report by the Southern Regional Education Board titled Focus on the School Calendar: The Four-Day School Week, ""Discussions about implementing four-day school weeks--with students attending school more hours each day--are surfacing again because of general economic pressures in the states and the increased cost of diesel fuel for school buses,"" although savings may vary from district to district, and the move may not result in significant drops in expenditures. For instance, a 20 percent reduction in transportation and food service spending--an impossibility given bus maintenance and other fixed costs--would only result in a savings of 2 percent of districts' overall budgets, the report said. Nevertheless, school districts nationally are increasingly looking at shortened weeks as one of several strategies to fight high fuel costs, including consolidating school bus routes, reducing the number of field trips, and requiring students to walk further distances to school.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 112","Initial Full Search",,

Four-day school week school districts in South Dakota rose over the course of 11 years from one in 1995 to 16 in 2006; this generated interest.    Information was gathered and compared for the 16 school districts for the year preceding implementation and the 2005-2006 school years. Areas of interest included student enrollment, certified staff numbers, attendance, drop-out and graduation rates, discipline incidents, achievement, and transportation budgets.    Five school districts were selected for an in-depth study. The selection was based on the following criteria: the superintendent was present in that position at the time that the school district implemented their four-day school week schedule, the school districts were not in their first year of implementation, the school districts represented eastern and western areas of the state, the school districts represented districts with large and small student populations, and the chosen school districts represented districts with a range of areas (as measured in square miles).    The researcher conducted 60 on-site interviews of stakeholder groups including superintendents, principals, teachers, students, and parents to learn about their perceptions concerning the four-day week.    Processes followed in planning and implementing a four-day school week schedule varied among the school districts. The advantages most often mentioned by stakeholders were improvement of morale, achievement, attendance, more family time, and supplementary programs. The disadvantages most often mentioned by stakeholders were the intensity or length of the school day and child care on the non-attendance day (Friday).    Student enrollment, the number of certified staff members, and graduation rates decreased in the majority of the 16 four-day week school districts during the time of comparison. Attendance, achievement, drop-out rates, and transportation costs increased in the majority of the sixteen four-day school weeks for the same time frame.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3054","Initial Full Search",,

Procedures for implementation are also included for evaluation in reducing effective schools.    School superintendents of four-day programs were surveyed to gain current information. The survey included demographic questions, cost efficiency questions about the school, and student achievement. Open ended questions were included to solicit responses as to the strength and weaknesses of four-day programs.    The findings indicated that school superintendents generally agree four-day programs are successful primarily in small rural areas. Schools do apparently show a reduction in operational costs. In comparing student achievement, the large majority of schools surveyed are performing as average or above both at their state level and nationally. The rankings are based on standardized achievement tests.    A list of advantages and disadvantages were compiled from surveys completed. The advantages were numerous and the disadvantages were limited. The most frequent advantages were lower costs, higher academics, and improved morale among students and staff.

Findings indicate that student achievement increased at some grade levels, and at other grade levels it was comparable with achievement for previous years. Other outcomes included high levels of student on-task behaviors, less disruption of instructional time, sustained student engagement, a decrease in employee and student absenteeism, and an approximate 1.6 percent savings in the district budget. However, the district abandoned the 4-day week after 1 year of implementation.

All school districts in the study had enrollments of 400 average daily membership or less. Student achievement was analyzed over an eight-year period. Student and faculty member-satisfaction was correlated with 1989 student achievement.    Several analyses were used to compare the variables. Student achievement in small rural schools was analyzed by a three-way ANOVA using grade level, days per week, and the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) scores as variables. The 1989 CTBS Scores were compared to student and faculty satisfaction, as measured by the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) Comprehensive Assessment of School Environments, using multiple regression techniques. Using discriminant analysis, student satisfaction and student achievement also predicted the number of days per week that students were in school.    The study indicated the CTBS scores of students in grades five and eight were significantly different ($<$0.05) between small rural four-day week schools and small rural five-day week schools in New Mexico. The four-day week student scores were significantly higher than the five-day week student scores over an eight-year period.    Indicators of student and faculty satisfaction, as determined by NASSP Satisfaction Surveys, showed no significant correlation with CTBS scores for the 1989 school year. When predicting student membership in a four-day or five-day week school, the discriminant analysis technique was accurate 66% of the time.","duplicate of 72","Initial Full Search",,

Two southern Oregon schools implemented the 4-day school week on a trial basis in 1982-83 and, along with five eastern Oregon districts, continue to use this schedule today. The primary purpose of the change to a 4-day week was reduction in cost. According to the enthusiastic responses of parents, staff, and students on annual surveys, the 4-day week produced: (1) a 15% to 23% reduction in transportation costs plus additional savings in energy costs and nonteacher salaries; (2) more actual learning time due to less set-up time and fewer interruptions; (3) more time for staff development, extracurricular activities, and family business; (4) less student and teacher absenteeism; (5) higher teacher morale and student enthusiasm; (6) more parental involvement; and (7) no adverse effects on student achievement. The following disadvantages have been noted: (1) difficulties if restoration of the 5-day week is desired; (2) increased costs for some parents; (3) increased teacher stress; (4) tiredness in younger children; (5) the impact of holidays on the schedule; and (6) concerns about the national movement toward a longer school year. An additional three eastern Oregon districts have successfully implemented a four and one half-day week.

A growing number of rural schools, faced with declining enrollments and diminishing state aid, are experimenting with this schedule. Benefits of the schedule include lower energy and transportation costs and lower absenteeism among students and teachers. Holding classes 7.5 hours a day, 4 days a week, provides the same amount of instructional time as the traditional schedule, but with more time-on-task and less wasted time. Students have had no real problems adjusting to the longer day. Teacher, student, and parent attitudes toward the 4-day week have been generally positive. The 10 New Mexico school districts operating on the 4-day week reported cost savings of 10-25% on fuel, electricity, and transportation; standardized achievement test scores comparable to state norms; and a collective dropout rate of 3.3% (versus 8.1% statewide). In the 12 Colorado districts on the 4-day schedule, students showed some gains and some losses in academic achievement, with no clear evidence that student achievement was suffering.

Advantages and disadvantages were discussed in addition to reviewing specific areas of cost effectiveness, student achievement, and staff development.    Questionnaires were mailed in April, 1984 to sixty-two public school officials throughout the United States representing eight states that operated the four-day school week. Fifty questionnaires were returned yielding an 80.6 percent return.    A review of the literature revealed that the four-day school week was a relatively new concept in school scheduling, having been in existence since the early 1970s. The primary reasons for implementing the four-day school were overcrowdedness, conserving energy, and reducing overall operating costs.    Some of the findings and conclusions based on the analysis of data follow:    Findings. (1) Colorado is the leading state in the United States which has school districts operating on the four-day school week, followed by New Mexico and Minnesota. Other states reporting experience with the four-day schedule include Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Utah. (2) One-hundred percent of the responding schools implementing the four-day schedule were from rural communities with seventy-six percent of the districts having enrollments of less than 1000 students. (3) The non-school day most frequently chosen was evenly divided between Monday and Friday. The four school days were commonly extended sixty or ninety minutes to equal the same amount of instructional time as the five-day schedule. (4) Although teacher salaries remained the same, cost savings from five to twenty percent in transportation, food service, custodial supplies, and heating costs were realized by implementing the four-day school week. (5) Ninety-seven percent of the superintendents indicated that the four-day school week had improved or not affected student achievement during the first year of implementation.    Conclusions. (1) The four-day school week is perceived as being successful in reducing operating costs, maintaining student achievement, reducing student and staff absenteeism, and improving morale of students and faculty. (2) The disadvantages of the four-day school week may be the supervision of students in the community on the non-school day and the longer school day for small children.

A first analysis identified two groups of students: one (N=62) provided a sequence starting with grade three and going through grade six, and a second (N=45) started with grade four and went through grade seven. A second analysis examined the performance of a given grade level for each of the four consecutive years for grades three, four, five, and six. Analysis of the ITBS scales revealed that the change to a four-day school week had no effect on student academic achievement, although there was a suggestion that there might be some leveling of performance during the first year the schools were on the four-day schedule. Analysis of the same grade level across the four-year period also provided no clear evidence that the change had any effect on student achievement. The significant differences might be explained by the observation that one year or class of students performs quite differently from another. (BRR)","duplicate of 19","Initial Full Search",,

The alternative schedule was approved by the Wyoming State Board of Education on two conditions. First, the State Attorney General must affirm the State Board's right to permit alternative scheduling. Second, an outside evaluation of the approach must be made. The services of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory were contracted by the District to plan and conduct an impartial evaluation. The overall purpose of the evaluation was to provide information which would be of value in weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative schedule. The most apparent effect of the four-day schedule was the generation of interest, enthusiasm and support for quality schooling on the part of all segments of the educational community--parents, teachers, students, and administrators. While the findings hint at benefits to be realized from the Sheridan plan, neither positive nor negative outcomes in student achievement could be shown. The community impact was split: most parents saw Fridays as positive opportunities for family activities, but families where both parents were working and the children were of elementary age viewed the four-day week negatively.

The aim of this study was to examine the relation between school schedule (morning school schedule and afternoon school schedule), sleep quality, and depression in Croatian adolescents. A total of 253 students of third and fourth grades of high school (17 and 18 years of age) completed measures of sleep quality and depression. Results have shown that participants who attend school in the morning also sleep less, have more difficulties in daily functioning due to problem with sleep and are more depressed, but their habitual sleep efficiency is better than in participants who attend school in the afternoon. Furthermore, depression was correlated with poorer sleep latency, sleep duration, more sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, daytime dysfunction, as well as poorer global sleep quality index. Finally, morning school schedule, poorer sleep duration, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction predicted depression, with sleep duration and daytime dysfunction mediating the relation between school schedule and depression.","duplicate of 233","Initial Full Search",,

One in five U.S. high school students report being bullied each school year and these students face greater risks of serious mental health challenges that extend into adulthood. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced most students into online education, many have worried that cyberbullying prevalence would grow dramatically. We use data from Google internet searches to examine changing bullying patterns as COVID-19 disrupted in-person schooling. Pre-pandemic historical patterns show that internet searches provide useful information about actual bullying behavior. Real-time data then shows that searches for school bullying and cyberbullying both dropped about 30-40 percent as schools shifted to remote learning in spring 2020. This drop is sustained through the fall and winter of the 2020-21 school year, though the gradual return to in-person instruction partially returns bullying searches to pre-pandemic levels. These results highlight how in-person interaction is an important mechanism underlying not only in-person school bullying, but also cyberbullying. We discuss how this otherwise damaging shock to students and schools provides insight into the mixed impact of the pandemic on student well-being.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 2206","Initial Full Search",,

The goals were to determine how changes in education during the COVID-19 pandemic (a) changed student perceptions of online education, (b) shifted student comfort with online education and communication, and (c) highlighted issues limiting student success. A link to an online survey was sent to SASES members in late 2020 resulting in 31 responses. Course format shifted from mostly face-to-face delivery to synchronous and asynchronous online delivery following the COVID-19 shutdown. Students perceived decreased instructor effort and increased student effort. Nearly all students had access to devices. However, access to fast, reliable internet was a common issue. A small percentage of students were more likely to take online courses after the pandemic, yet a majority were now more comfortable taking online classes and using virtual meeting software. Student concern for COVID-19 was low. However, most reported wearing masks in buildings and on campus.

Allocating time for professional development throughout the day and school year can be challenging, often resulting in teachers forgoing professional development altogether. As a result, teacher efficiency in the classroom is impacted, with a resulting impact on student achievement.  The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine math teachers’ experiences attending professional development during a four-day instructional week in East Texas. This alternative schedule provided for a full day of professional development for math teachers during the work week. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews with six math teachers and triangulated with interviews from three other staff members working in this setting at a middle school. Data analysis occurred through open coding and axial coding resulting in four themes. This study found that teachers felt a need to be supported by their administration, and that teachers felt that a day of professional development was overall more beneficial to them and their students in lieu of an additional day of instruction. Implications for the findings and recommendations include teachers and administrators working together to help teachers feel supported, teachers finding time to make sure professional development is a priority, and teachers attending professional development they feel will help them be more effective.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3039","Initial Full Search",,

Accordingly, there has been growing interest in understanding why children are absent and whether certain early educational experiences can reduce children's rates of school absences. Objective: The objective of this investigation was to estimate the additive and multiplicative benefits of children's early school experiences in preschool (center-based care) and kindergarten (center-based care and full day kindergarten enrollment) for patterns of school absenteeism in kindergarten and first grade. Method: To address these objectives, data were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011 and included 12,835 children and families. Results: Children who attended center-based care in preschool and kindergarten had fewer missed school days and were less likely to be chronically absent in kindergarten and first grade. Children in full-day kindergarten programs had more absences by the end of kindergarten, but fewer absences by the end of the following year. No specific combination of early school arrangements was most beneficial. Instead, children who experienced more early educational arrangements were generally absent less frequently and these benefits were larger in first grade than in kindergarten. Conclusions: When taken together, findings underscore the importance of formal early educational programs and opportunities on longer-term school attendance.

Design: The project was part of a larger, 2-year cross-sectional study. Setting: Full-day kindergarten classrooms across London, Ontario, Canada. Methods: Participants included 113 young children (mean age = 4.69 years; standard deviation [SD ] = 0.66 years) from eligible full-day kindergarten programmes. Participants' physical activity and sedentary data were collected using Actical accelerometers worn for five consecutive days during school hours only. Type of school schedule and periods of outdoor play were captured using the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation tool. Results: Participants mean activity rates (i.e. sedentary time, light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA] and total physical activity [TPA]) during school hours were similar across both formats. Participants' overall daily physical activity and sedentary time did not significantly differ across school schedule type (p > .05); however, participants adhering to the traditional schedule accumulated significantly more TPA outdoors than those following the balanced day schedule. Conclusion: Neither schedule format appeared to be superior with regard to supporting overall daily physical activity nor minimising sedentary time in school, although children adhering to the traditional schedule format did accumulate more physical activity during periods of outdoor play. Regardless of schedule type, steps are warranted to encourage additional movement (and minimise sedentary behaviours) in the school setting by school and public health officials.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 2338","Initial Full Search",,

No. 38","This issue of ""Education Indicators in Focus"" reports that Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries organise learning time for primary and secondary education in different ways: (1) The number and length of school holidays differs significantly across OECD countries, meaning the number of instructional days in primary and secondary education ranges from 162 days a year in France to more than 200 days in Israel and Japan; (2) The higher the level of education, the greater the number of instructional hours per school day. Students in OECD countries are expected to receive on average 4.3 hours of instruction per day in primary school, rising to 5.2 hours in upper secondary school; (3) On average across OECD countries, around half of primary schools' compulsory curricular time is focused on reading, writing and literature; mathematics; and science, amounting to 2.2 hours per school day. In lower secondary education this falls to only 1.8 hours per day; and (4) There are wide variations across OECD countries in the organisation of the learning time within and outside the classroom but there has been a recent trend of increasing classroom instruction time dedicated to core subjects such as mathematics, and a reduction in the time spent doing homework outside the classroom. The brief concludes that the number of instructional hours students are expected to receive during compulsory education and the length of the school year vary significantly between countries but in general the higher the level of education, the greater the number of instruction hours per school day. In many countries, primary and secondary students have homework to do and can participate in after-school lessons to complement their learning time. Matching resources with students' needs and making optimal use of time are central to education policy but the wide variation across OECD countries in the organisation of the learning time within and outside the classroom suggests that countries have not worked out what the evidence says about the most effective use of students' time.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 2358","Initial Full Search",,

In each of these 15 areas, teams of teachers are able to secure full or partial autonomy. This paper describes the 15 areas of autonomy. Each description is a series of real-life examples of decisions teams of teachers have made using full or partial autonomy in each autonomy area.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 2378","Initial Full Search",,

1556,"Christensen, Kathleen, Schneider, Barbara, Butler, Donnell","Families with School-Age Children","Most working parents face a common dilemma--how to care for their children when they are not in school but the parents are at work. In this article Kathleen Christensen, Barbara Schneider, and Donnell Butler describe the predictable and unpredictable scheduling demands school-age children place on working couples and single working parents. The authors assess the potential capacity of schools to help meet the needs of working families through changes in school schedules and after-school programs and conclude that the flexibility parents need to balance family-work responsibilities probably cannot be found in the school setting. They argue that workplaces are better able than schools to offer the flexibility that working parents need to attend to basic needs of their children, as well as to engage in activities that enhance their children's academic performance and emotional and social well-being. Two types of flexible work practices seem especially well suited to parents who work: flextime arrangements that allow parents to coordinate their work schedules with their children's school schedules, and policies that allow workers to take short periods of time off--a few hours or a day or two--to attend a parent-teacher conference, for example, or care for a child who has suddenly fallen ill. Many companies that have instituted such policies have benefited through employees' greater job satisfaction and employee retention. Yet despite these measured benefits to employers, workplaces often fall short of being family friendly. Many employers do not offer such policies or offer them only to employees at certain levels or in certain types of jobs. Flexible work practices are almost nonexistent for low-income workers, who are least able to afford alternative child care and may need flexibility the most. Moreover the authors find that even employees in firms with flexible practices such as telecommuting may be reluctant to take advantage of them, because the workplace culture explicitly or implicitly stigmatizes or penalizes employees for choosing these work arrangements. The authors conclude by making a case for creating a workplace culture that supports flexibility. Such a culture, they argue, would enable working parents to better meet the responsibilities of their jobs as they care for and build strong relationships with their children.

Such competition could have adverse financial and programmatic impacts on traditional schools. The purpose of this study was to determine if a local district- managed traditional school could compete with a local, independent charter school by making changes to the traditional school’s curriculum, schedule, and teacher delivery of the curriculum. The conceptual framework for this study was that of educational entrepreneurship. The questions guiding the research concerned understanding whether recent initiatives influenced parents’ and students’ selection of the traditional school over the charter school. This exploratory case study utilized data collected through student, parent, and faculty questionnaires and interviews conducted to evaluate the traditional school’s initiatives to increase student enrollment. The researcher identified common themes from the questionnaires and interviews. Results, suggested that students attended the traditional school because they could earn credits quickly, the traditional school’s 4 day schedule, and the individualized instruction. Implications for social change including increasing student enrollments by way of helping traditional schools to be more competitive with charter schools. This could result in more educational choices for students and parents resulting in an increased graduation rate.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3013","Initial Full Search",,

In order to examine the influence of this reform, this study compared the similarities and differences in curricular practices in kindergartens with different sponsoring bodies in Shanxi province. Altogether, 26 principals and 95 teachers in 50 classrooms from 26 kindergartens participated in the study. Principals and teachers completed questionnaires and were interviewed and kindergartens were observed. Results indicated that kindergartens in Shanxi have made great progress in the arrangement of indoor space, arranging the schedule and allocating attention to individual needs. Kindergartens under local education bureaux and work units were significantly better than kindergartens under town governments in these aspects. But kindergartens with different sponsoring bodies still have not attained the reform objectives in terms of teacher-child interactions and the organization of curricular activities. There was a relation between resource availability and curricular practice and the influences of the macro culture and educational institutions on curricular practice are discussed.

1778,"Young, Beth, Brooks, Mary","Part-Time Politics: The Micropolitical World of Part-Time Teaching","During a multi-district study on part-time teaching employment, part-time teachers, school administrators, and teachers' association officials spoke about a range of micropolitical activities related to part-time teaching arrangements as a component of flexible workforces and as an element of flexible workplaces. The study was conducted in one Canadian province during a period of rapidly imposed changes, including funding cuts, typical of the globalized school restructuring movement. We describe administrators' strategic efforts to mobilize their biases related to part-time teaching employment by organizing their micropolitical resources either to support that preference or to minimize such arrangements. We discuss the strategies that part-time teachers used in order to survive as flexible workers, and sometimes to flourish in rather fragile versions of flexible workplaces. We conclude by noting micropolitical themes that have application beyond the little-studied subculture of part-time teaching. These themes offer insights about power, perceptions, values, and gender that apply more widely to the micropolitics of school organizations.

The purpose of this study was to compare test scores of students on the 4x4 block schedule and students on the seven-period traditional schedule using the End-of-Course testing program scores in the North Carolina ABC accountability model to determine if significant differences exist. The tested areas this researcher examined were Algebra I and Biology in an urban school system.    The population in the study was extracted from data files of four schools in the Cumberland County School System, Fayetteville, North Carolina. They were Terry Sanford Senior High School and Seventy First Senior High School, which are on the traditional seven-period day schedule, as well as South View Senior High School and Jack Britt Senior High School, which are on the 4x4 block schedule. The scores on the End-of-Course Tests in Algebra I and Biology over the period of 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 were compared.    The conclusion of the study indicated that there was a significant difference in student achievement for all students, minority, non-minority, female, and male in Algebra I on the 4 x 4 schedule versus all students, minority, non-minority, female, and male in Algebra I on the traditional schedule. There was a significant difference in student achievement for minority students in Biology on the 4 x 4 schedule versus minority students in Biology on the traditional schedule. There was no significant difference in student achievement for all students, non-minority, female, and male students in Biology on the 4 x 4 versus all students, non-minority, female, and male in Biology on the traditional schedule.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 2634","Initial Full Search",,

1979,"Taylor, Lyndon E.","Redefining the Community College for the Year 2000","This paper traces an administrator's view of the changes necessary to make the community college a viable force in postsecondary education. First, problems and challenges facing the United States in general are reviewed, including rising illiteracy and dropout rates among the nation's high school students, increasing violence and crime in the society at large, the high rate of unemployment connected to the information age, and the shift from a state or national economy to a global one. Next, areas of unresponsiveness and rigidity in the nation's two-year educational system are examined, with respect to an adherence to the traditional summer vacation schedule, a tendency to keep the status quo in teaching methods, a lack of responsiveness to individual students' needs, and a tendency to lose sight of the value of quality control. In the context of these problems, 10 key areas in which community college educators should work for change are presented. Among the areas included are the need for an exploration of alternative sources of income for research and development, a reexamination of instructional and scheduling methods, the utilization of existing technology to better inform and serve students in the areas of registration and data dissemination, and the creation of an atmosphere on campus that welcomes change and creativity. Finally, a brief discussion is provided of the development of an education center in the North Orange County Community College District. The center will consist of both entrepreneurial activities to provide funding for research and development, and an adult educational facility, utilizing a general education core curriculum as well as alternative instructional delivery strategies.

Agenda Item 6","Regulations proposed by the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges are presented in an attempt to clarify terminology in state legislation regarding: (1) attendance accounting standards to be used in determining state aid to colleges (California Education Code Section 84500) and (2) the ""175-Day Rule"" (Education Code Section 84370), which requires districts to maintain their colleges at least 175 days each fiscal year. The paper first examines the controversial interpretation of the statutes used by the State Board of Finance in a series of compliance audits and thus demonstrates the need for the Board of Governors to clearly define statutory language dealing with conditions for claiming attendance, the educational activities required of the students, the necessary presence of an instructor, and the inclusion of evening classes in counting school days. Highlights of the resultant clarifying regulations are then outlined, including a legal definition for ""immediate supervision and control"" of students; guidelines for determining who is legally qualified to provide supervision; and criteria for determining how regular school days are to be counted under the 175-Day Rule.

Research Monographs II, IV, VII, X, and XIV","Of the 14 institutional research projects undertaken at South Oklahoma City Junior College during fiscal year 1979, four are summarized in this compilation which also contains a bibliography on non-traditional education in the two-year college setting. The first report presents, in three tables, a count of classes by time of day for the 1977, 1978, and 1979 Fall entry points. While the tables show similar room usage patterns, there was a slight decrease from 1978 to 1979. The second report outlines the results of a survey conducted in Fall 1978 to determine student attitudes towards the college's new Saturday class offerings. Selected findings indicate that students became aware of the new classes through signs on the campus, word of mouth, and the campus class schedule. Most students (71.3%) were enrolled in only one class, and 95% felt that class times were meeting their needs. The third report discusses the results of a survey of 21 instructors conducted in March, 1979, to determine their reactions to the newly designed ""quad-pod"" classrooms. The majority (61%) rated the ""quad-pods"" poor or very poor, complaining of too much noise and inadequate lighting. The final report outlines the results of a participant evaluation of a workshop that was held in April, 1979, to determine 1980 institutional goals.

No. 023","Empirical analysis of secondary microdata, bespoke social mobility surveys and administrative school attendance data reveal the extent of learning losses that have evolved in the four nations of the UK over the year of the pandemic. They are sizable in all four nations, with a common feature of disadvantaged pupils suffering particularly large losses during two periods of school closures, the durations of which varied across the home nations. Between March 2020 and April 2021, the following maximum number of classroom days were lost over one calendar year: 110 days (England); 119 days (Northern Ireland); 119 days (Scotland); 124 days (Wales). These compare to a full year during normal times of 190 classroom days. Considering learning undertaken at home and in the classroom, pupils in England lost 61 days of schooling. Larger average losses occurred in Scotland (64 days) and Wales (66 days), while pupils in Northern Ireland also lost 61 days. The differences across the nations arise both because of variations in learning loss at home, and due to education policy differences (both historical differences in term times and from specific policy choices during the pandemic). Rising school absences in June/July 2021 once prompt discussion about credible policies to address learning losses. Survey responses reveal that 53 percent of 10,000 adults support extending the school day, while seven in ten respondents support allowing greater flexibility for pupils to repeat a whole school year.","duplicate of 1228","Initial Full Search",,
2250,,"Head Start Dosage: Is More Better? Research Notes","Early educational interventions, such as Head Start, have been widely recognized as an effective way to mitigate the negative effects of poverty on early learning and development (Camilli, Vargas, Ryan, & Barnett, 2010). In the past decade, there has been a strong expansion of early childhood programming, including Head Start and state-funded prekindergarten programs. However, the cost of the programs calls into question the extent to which this expansion can be maintained. A tension exists between serving as many children as possible and providing the most impact with limited economic resources (e.g., Barnett & Hustedt, 2011; Steuerle, Reynolds, & Carasso, 2007), making the study of program design such as length and intensity of programming critical to efforts to serve low-income or at-risk children in the most efficient fashion. This paper reviews two frequently cited studies that looked at Head Start programs, the nation's largest early educational intervention, and examined the impact of one program factor, intervention dosage, on children's school readiness outcomes. In the two studies, program dosage was defined as the amount of services children received, and was measured as the duration of program enrollment (i.e., one year versus two years) and the intensity of the program (i.e., half day versus full day).","duplicate of 1296","Initial Full Search",,

Scheduling, the structure of the school day, the length of school year and pedagogic practices in general, although moderately successful, are frequently defined by mantras and rationales out of step with current research or anchored on educational myth. This duality of educational practices is often similarly and vehemently supported by academia and practice. This creates a nebulous and needlessly complex roadmap for reform. Administrators are encouraged to identify the needs of their school communities and implement practices that best fit their unique identity keeping in mind the human element and the nature of change. Consideration for a fluid and agile mindset that is growth focused is suggested for negotiating change.","duplicate of 1306","Initial Full Search",,

Design: The project was part of a larger, 2-year cross-sectional study. Setting: Full-day kindergarten classrooms across London, Ontario, Canada. Methods: Participants included 113 young children (mean age = 4.69 years; standard deviation [SD ] = 0.66 years) from eligible full-day kindergarten programmes. Participants' physical activity and sedentary data were collected using Actical accelerometers worn for five consecutive days during school hours only. Type of school schedule and periods of outdoor play were captured using the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation tool. Results: Participants mean activity rates (i.e. sedentary time, light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA] and total physical activity [TPA]) during school hours were similar across both formats. Participants' overall daily physical activity and sedentary time did not significantly differ across school schedule type (p .05); however, participants adhering to the traditional schedule accumulated significantly more TPA outdoors than those following the balanced day schedule. Conclusion: Neither schedule format appeared to be superior with regard to supporting overall daily physical activity nor minimising sedentary time in school, although children adhering to the traditional schedule format did accumulate more physical activity during periods of outdoor play. Regardless of schedule type, steps are warranted to encourage additional movement (and minimise sedentary behaviours) in the school setting by school and public health officials.

Numerous studies of information processing theory and the spacing effect on learning have been conducted; they have produced mixed findings. Relatively few studies have been conducted to specifically study the effect of class scheduling on student outcomes in mathematics courses. The research hypothesis for this study is that student outcomes are better in class sections that meet more frequently and with shorter duration. Regardless of analytical methods implemented in this study, none of the results support the assertion that student outcomes in Intermediate Algebra are better in classes that meet more frequently and with sessions of short duration. This study provides a reasonable basis for asserting that class schedule is not a predictor of student outcomes in developmental math. Furthermore, we find no evidence that providing a variety of class scheduling options will adversely impact student outcomes in Intermediate Algebra. Until more definitive research is conducted on the topic, providing a variety of class scheduling options may be the best approach to serving the needs of developmental mathematics students and their institutions.","duplicate of 2405","Initial Full Search",,

2574,"Oths, Kathryn S, Robertson, Tara","Give Me Shelter: Temporal Patterns of Women Fleeing Domestic Abuse","Domestic violence is a growing public health concern in the United States. Research to date has focused more on why women stay in abusive relationships than on factors influencing their leaving. The work presented here explores the social structural connections between culturally defined social events and the timing of entry into the shelter system. Handwerker's (1996) taxonomy of the causal theories of domestic violence is used and expanded upon here as an organizing framework for exploring the leaving process. This study investigates the temporal patterns of domestic violence crisis line and safe house use by the hour, day, and month, including women's motivations for seeking help when they do. Analyses were based on a review of 2,387 crisis call records covering a three-year period, supplemented by formal and informal interviews with abused women and agency staff. The widely held belief that more women seek shelter during 'drinking holidays' such as New Year's and the Super Bowl was unsubstantiated, while the contention that women with school-aged children time their leaving to coincide with breaks in the academic schedule was supported. The patterning of domestic violence calls to the shelter is the mirror opposite of that previously found for calls to police and emergency room visits.

If full-day kindergarten increases learning, are kindergartners in some schools particularly advantaged by their full-day experience? We address these questions with a nationally representative sample of over 8,000 kindergartners and 500 U.S. public schools that participated in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort. More than half of kindergartners experience full-day programs, which are most commonly available to less-advantaged children. Using multilevel (HLM) methods, we show that children who attend schools that offer full-day programs learn more in literacy and mathematics than their half-day counterparts. We also explore differential effectiveness in some school settings. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","duplicate of 1731","Initial Full Search",,

However, the impacts of FDSWs on physical activity exposure and related outcomes  are unknown. This study examined physical education (PE) exposure and childhood  obesity prevalence in 4- versus 5-day Oregon schools; the authors hypothesized  lower PE exposure and higher obesity in FDSW schools, given reduced school  environment exposure. METHODS: The authors utilized existing data from Oregon to  compare 4- versus 5-day models: t tests compared mean school-level factors (PE  exposure, time in school, enrollment, and demographics) and complex samples  weighted t tests compared mean child-level obesity data for a state  representative sample of first to third graders (N = 4625). RESULTS: Enrollment,  time in school, and student-teacher ratio were significantly lower in FDSW  schools. FDSW schools provided significantly more PE, both in minutes (120 vs  101 min/wk in 4- vs 5-d schools, P < .01) and relative to total time in school  (6.9% vs 5.0%, P < .0001). Obesity prevalence did not differ significantly  between school models. CONCLUSION: Greater PE exposure in FDSW schools was  observed, and it remains unknown whether differences in PE exposure contributed  to obesity prevalence in this sample of students. Efforts to better understand  how FDSWs impact physical activity, obesity risk, and related factors are needed.","duplicate of 48","Initial Full Search",,

METHODS: The sample consisted of 200 students  (107 girls, 93 boys; ages 6 to 8) and their school day PA was monitored with  hip-worn ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers across a 5-day school week and the  thresholds 100 and 2296 count per minute were used to separate sedentary time,  light PA, and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). RESULTS: On an average school day,  students were engaged in MVPA for 20.0 min in the U.S. and 24.1 min in Finland.  Students' school-day MVPA was 9 to 16 minutes higher during physical education  (PE) days compared with non-PE days (U.S: 25.8 vs. 16.6 min/day; Finland: 36.3  vs. 20.1 min/day). Girls had less MVPA and more sedentary time compared with boys  in both samples. CONCLUSION: This study highlights both the role of PE and other  school day physical activities in meeting PA guidelines.

This study examined associations of reduced school exposure via  FDSWs with adolescent health and risk behaviors, obesity, and food security.  METHODS: Self-report data from 8th- and 11th-grade students from the Oregon  Healthy Teens survey across 5 survey years (odd years 2007-2015, total  N = 91,860-104,108 respondents depending on the survey question) were linked to a  FDSW indicator. Regression analyses controlling for student and school  characteristics compared outcomes between students in 4- and 5-day schools  overall (without school fixed effects) and outcomes associated with switching to  a FDSW (with school fixed effects). RESULTS: When controlling for multiple  student- and school-level factors, we observed adolescents in FDSW schools report  they consume sugar sweetened beverages more frequently and water less frequently,  have access to fewer days of physical education, are more likely to be food  insecure, and are more likely to report the use of any drugs and specifically  marijuana than 5-day school week students.

We aimed to assess the effects of playground marking on  objectively measured school recess physical activity in French children. METHODS:  Participants were four hundred and twenty children (6-11years old) from 4 primary  schools in Nord-Pas de Calais, France. Children's physical activity (PA) was  measured with a uniaxial accelerometer twice a day (morning and afternoon recess)  during a 4-day school week in April and May 2009. Two experimental schools (EG)  received a recess-based intervention (playground markings) and two others served  as controls (CG). Percentage of time spent on the following intensities of  physical activity during school recess was measured before and after  intervention: sedentary (SED), light physical activity (LPA), moderate physical  activity (MPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), very high physical activity  (VHPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). RESULTS: At baseline,  school recess PA among children from CG was significantly (p<0.001) higher than  that among EG children. No interaction was observed between the recess-based  intervention and gender.

The saving of money is always needed to assure that we make the most of our tax dollars without spending more than is required. The purpose of this quantitative study was to identify the relationship between student test scores from a five-day school week and student test scores from a four-day school week. This study also sought to identify the relationship between student attendance rates for students attending a five-day school week and attendance rates for students attending a four-day school week. Student ACT composite test scores and attendance rates were acquired using statistical information gathered by the state's department of education's website annually. Student ACT composite scores compiled prior to the move to a four day school week were compared to the ACT composite scores compiled during the years the same school followed a traditional five-day school week. School student attendance rates compiled prior to the move to a four day school week were compared to the school student attendance rates compiled during the years the same school followed a traditional five-day school week. Dependent t-tests of reliability were used along with Cohen's d strength tests to compare student ACT Composite test scores and attendance rates before and after the conversion to four-day school weeks. The results of this study show test result and student attendance downward trends that may be worthwhile studying in the future when more examples and more data become available. When the attendance rates of the schools in this study that converted to a four-day school week were averaged together, the attendance rates of the schools in this study went down .13 percent. This was not found to be a significant difference. The ACT Composite test scores of the schools in this study, when averaged together, went down an average of .49 points which was found to be an insignificant difference despite two outlier schools whose scores went down over two points on average. The conversion to a four-day school week may or may not be deemed successful due to the increase in attendance for the schools involved depending on the goal of the school and whether they believe less than half of a point in test score drops is too significant compared to the maximum increase in attendance of 7.9 percent.

Such competition could have adverse financial and programmatic impacts on traditional schools. The purpose of this study was to determine if a local district- managed traditional school could compete with a local, independent charter school by making changes to the traditional school’s curriculum, schedule, and teacher delivery of the curriculum. The conceptual framework for this study was that of educational entrepreneurship. The questions guiding the research concerned understanding whether recent initiatives influenced parents’ and students’ selection of the traditional school over the charter school. This exploratory case study utilized data collected through student, parent, and faculty questionnaires and interviews conducted to evaluate the traditional school’s initiatives to increase student enrollment. The researcher identified common themes from the questionnaires and interviews. Results, suggested that students attended the traditional school because they could earn credits quickly, the traditional school’s 4 day schedule, and the individualized instruction. Implications for social change including increasing student enrollments by way of helping traditional schools to be more competitive with charter schools.

The research question studied was what is the relationship between the four–day school week and teacher retention in rural school districts? Within the quantitative research design, the causal–comparative design was the selected procedure. The sample in this study was public educators teaching in rural public-school districts with a four-day school week as compared to teachers with a five-day school week from the state of Idaho. This data was collected in the Fall of 2021 into the Spring of 2022 from databases in the West and Midwest regions of the United States. Next, descriptive statistics were employed, including independent sample t-tests to investigate the discrepancies in teacher retention rates among rural public schools with four-day school weeks and those five-day school weeks by a variety of variables. The research compared teacher retention in rural school districts on the four-day school week to the rate of teacher retention in rural school districts on the five-day school week. Three years of historical teacher retention data was collected from the Idaho Department of Education beginning with the 2017-2018 school year and ending with the 2019-2020 school year. While results indicate that school districts on a five-day school week consistently had a higher rate of teacher retention when compared to districts on a four-day school week, there was no statistically significant impact (p>_.05).

In recent years, studies have focused on the instructional benefits of making the switch from a five-day to four-day school week. Effective use of time as an instructional resource plays a meaningful role in educational leadership activities of school district superintendents. This multisite case study sought to describe the perceptions of 10 South Dakota superintendents employed in school districts using a four-day calendar regarding the quality of their professional development programs. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview based on the McREL Professional Development Audit. Additional data gathered by the researcher included school district demographics, professional development planning documents, school calendars, and district websites. Superintendents believed the four-day school week calendar provided the time to make a positive impact on the vision and goals, planning, design, resources, and evaluation components of a high quality professional development program. The study supported current research that district planners should provide professional development time that is organized, structured, and purposefully driven. Common themes among respondents included (a) articulate and set as a strategic goal during the calendar adoption process the importance of implementing a high quality professional development program for teachers and set specific dates within the calendar assigned for professional development (b) incorporate student remedial activities into the calendar (c) provide fiscal resources to support the professional development program, and (d) demonstrate effective administrative leadership to ensure fidelity in the design and implementation of the district's professional development program.

The four-day school week has been credited with producing a number of potential benefits and consequences, but there is currently a limited amount of research available to determine the overall worth of the practice compared to the five-day school week. Some purported impacts of the four-day school week include shifts in teacher and student attendance, changes in achievement, financial adjustments, decreases in dropout rates, and improvement in morale (Plucker, Cierniak, & Chamberlin, 2012). This study involved investigating the system-wide impact of the four-day school week by examining attendance, ACT scores, and dropout rates before and after implementation in participating school districts across Missouri. Additionally, the school climate perceptions of Missouri administrators and teachers who work within the four-day school week were collected. Interview responses were then analyzed using coding methods to identify common phrases, key words, and themes, while the quantitative data were treated to examine pre- and post-implementation patterns. The findings of this study revealed the four-day school week produced a statistically positive significant impact on attendance, whereas ACT scores and dropout rates were not influenced.

The product will provide school districts with a resource to address their needs, questions, and concerns around all aspects of the transition to a four-day school week, including policy, community relations, human resources, scheduling, finances, and student achievement. Over the past five years, weakening economic conditions have wreaked havoc across the country in most industries. Missouri public school districts have not been spared the hardship, as decreases in property tax subsidies and state budget shortfalls create lasting deficiencies in funding. With the passage of four-day school week/alternative calendar legislation, this economic crisis has spurred school districts in Missouri and across the nation to investigate options for an alternative calendar or four-day school week in order to reduce spending. The need for an operations manual surfaced as the team examined four-day school week research and during the interviews of state department leaders from many states expressing limited guidance existed for districts investigating or making the transition to a four-day school week. District leaders considering this change have been forced to conduct their own research and develop an implementation plan without any guidance. As more and more districts consider this option, it will be beneficial for them to have a guide with the resources needed to implement the four-day school week. The purpose of this study was to identify what school leaders and policymakers need to know when considering or implementing a four-day school week. An expert panel, consisting of school leaders and state education officials knowledgeable in educational policy and in the research and practice of school district administration reviewed the operations manual as part of the pilot. Following the expert panel review, the manual was refined based on recommendations and submitted to another expert panel for field test feedback.

Children above the 90th percentile for BMI are particularly susceptible to cardiovascular health risks. There remains a minimal understanding of theory-based psychological predictors of physical activity and weight change in children. This research incorporated data from a subsample of afterschool care enrollees above the 90th BMI percentile (Mage=10.1 years) who participated in either 4-day/week (n = 21) or 3-day/week (n = 24) versions of a 45 min/session, cognitive-behaviorally based physical activity/health behavior-change program over a full school year, or a control condition of usual care (n = 14). For the cognitive-behavioral groups only, significant improvements were found in self-regulation, mood, and physical activity. Their BMI increases of 0.12 and 0.11 kg/m², respectively, were significantly less than the 0.90 kg/m² rise expected through maturation. Theory-based regression models uniformly confirmed significant associations of changes in self-regulation and physical activity (R²s = .22–.25). However, within separate analyses, entry of changes in (a) self-efficacy and mood into a multiple regression equation, (b) self-efficacy as a mediator, and (c) mood as a moderator, did not increase predictive accuracies. The significant association of changes in physical activity and BMI was stronger in the heavier children. Findings will be useful for large-scale intervention applications and refinements.

The MontCAS is the standardized assessment in reading, mathematics, and science adopted by the Montana Office of Public Instruction as a result of mandates from the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. In the spring of 2005, the Montana Legislature approved changes to the accreditation standards in Montana by allowing a school to be accredited based upon a total number of contact hours instead of the previous requirement of a minimum number of contact hours and a minimum number of days of instruction. Ten schools made the conversion to a four day week beginning in the 2006-2007 school year. By 2008-2009 there were 22 schools following a four day week calendar and over the next several years, this number doubled every two years. By the 2012-2013 school year, there were over 100 schools in Montana with a four day week. Data was provided by the Montana Office of Public Instruction on every student from every school in Montana that utilized the four day school week from implementation through the 2012-2013 school year. This data was analyzed by cohort based upon the year of implementation of the four day week in addition to being considered in the composite as the number of students tested in schools with the four day week grew from just over 200 in the spring of 2007 to 2685 in the spring of 2013. The total percentage of students identified as proficient and advanced was compared to state-wide averages disaggregated by cohort and in composite over the academic years of 2006-2007 through 2012-2013.

The researcher conducted a census during the fall of 2012, distributing a demographic survey to all 23 of the high school teachers teaching in the target high school in a small rural school district in the western United States which had adopted the four-day school week in 2005. The researcher interviewed eight of the high school teachers who met the inclusion criteria regarding experience with both the four- and five-day school schedule. The focus of the study was on the qualitative data, with aggregate quantitative data regarding student and teacher attendance and ISAT scores collected from the District through the State's Department of Education website, used to explicate the qualitative findings. The overall feeling among interviewees regarding attendance of both students and teachers was that it either improved permanently, improved temporarily, or there was no change. All eight interviewees felt that at worst there had been no change, or that student achievement improved with the move to the four-day school week schedule. The researcher also included teacher perceptions regarding other areas such as schedule transition, teacher morale, use of instructional time, teacher planning and collaboration, and professional development. The interviewees felt pleased with their school's transition to a four-day school week schedule and felt that teacher morale had improved with the change. It was perceived that the four-day week allowed for more quality instructional time, with more time to plan and coordinate lesson plans. While the quantitative data trends implied student achievement fluctuation more so than strong positive achievement gains, like the qualitative findings, negative or downward trends were not evidenced.

This collective case study was undertaken to examine the perceptions of administrators, school counselors, and teachers on the four-day school week and the impact of the new calendar format on teacher recruitment, teacher retention, and job satisfaction. Three school districts were studied; each began implementation of the four-day school week during the 2015--2016 academic year. A total of 21 school personnel were interviewed, including three superintendents, three building administrators, three school counselors, and 12 teachers. Participants overwhelmingly identified the four-day school week as a benefit to them personally, citing the ability to balance work and family as positive. Employees of two of the three school districts reported improved ability to recruit potential candidates for teaching positions. Educators from all three districts reported an improvement in teacher retention, as the four-day schedule is very popular with teachers. Also noted as valuable and important to the teaching staff is the additional time for professional development and collaboration built into the school calendar. Given the difficulties small rural school districts frequently face when securing and retaining a highly qualified teaching staff, the findings of this study point to an unintended, yet powerful outcome of implementation of the four-day school week--the ability to recruit and retain teachers.

Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district.

However, the impacts of FDSWs on physical activity exposure and related outcomes are unknown. This study examined physical education (PE) exposure and childhood obesity prevalence in 4-versus 5-day Oregon schools; the authors hypothesized lower PE exposure and higher obesity in FDSW schools, given reduced school environment exposure. Methods: The authors utilized existing data from Oregon to compare 4-versus 5-day models: t tests compared mean school-level factors (PE exposure, time in school, enrollment, and demographics) and complex samples weighted t tests compared mean child-level obesity data for a state representative sample of first to third graders (N = 4625). Results: Enrollment,time in school, and student–teacher ratio were significantly lower in FDSW schools. FDSW schools provided significantly more PE, both in minutes (120 vs 101 min/wk in 4- vs 5-d schools, P P < .0001). Obesity prevalence did not differ significantly between school models. Conclusion: Greater PE exposure in FDSW schools was observed, and it remains unknown whether differences in PE exposure contributed to obesity prevalence in this sample of students. Efforts to better understand how FDSWs impact physical activity, obesity risk, and related factors are needed.

First, the researcher collected data from the human resources department about teacher retention rates and the number of applicants who applied for teaching positions in the district for a period of three year prior to becoming a four-day school week district. Second, the researcher sent out anonymous surveys to all teachers in the school district to collect information from open-ended questions about the reasons they either joined or stayed with a four-day school district. Lastly, the researcher collected data from the human resources department about teacher retention rates and the number of applicants who applied for teaching positions in the district for each school year since implementing the four-day school week.

Studies to date have shown mixed results and often rely on self-reported data. Multi-player gaming may augment participation. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine children’s adherence behaviors in multi-player online exergames compared to a single-player condition within a home environment. Methods: Seventy-two children, aged 9–12 years, who were not meeting physical activity guidelines at baseline, were allocated to the multi-player or single-player condition. Six-week cycle-based exergaming trials took place 5 day/week in the early evening with online game supervision. Bike use was objectively recorded via game logs. Results: Adherence was high throughout the trial. Play session duration was M = 37.65 (SD = 15.39) min/day, and overall play duration was M = 133.45 (SD = 81.27) min in Week 1 and M = 77.23 (SD = 84.09) min in Week 6. Total physical activity was significantly higher at 6 weeks compared to baseline (p = .01, ηp² = .13). There was no significant difference in play duration between conditions (p = .57, ηp² = .01). Conclusion: This trial objectively demonstrated that exergames can promote high adherence levels. Multi-player capabilities did not augment adherence levels. Introducing new games throughout the trial may have motivated participants to keep playing, regardless of whether play was against real or artificial opponents. Weekly play duration decreased due to a significant drop in play frequency. For children who enjoy exergames, innovative solutions to promote more frequent exergame play are needed.

We aimed to assess the effects of playground marking on objectively measured school recess physical activity in French children. Methods: Participants were four hundred and twenty children (6–11 years old) from 4 primary schools in Nord-Pas de Calais, France. Children's physical activity (PA) was measured with a uniaxial accelerometer twice a day (morning and afternoon recess) during a 4-day school week in April and May 2009. Two experimental schools (EG) received a recess-based intervention (playground markings) and two others served as controls (CG). Percentage of time spent on the following intensities of physical activity during school recess was measured before and after intervention: sedentary (SED), light physical activity (LPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), very high physical activity (VHPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Results: At baseline, school recess PA among children from CG was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that among EG children. No interaction was observed between the recess-based intervention and gender. After the intervention, the EG spent significantly (p b 0.05)more time inMPA, VPA and MVPA with a concomitant significant decrease in SED (p < 0.05) compared to baseline, while the PA in CG remained unchanged.

The Physio-Cat Program, designed by this researcher, was developed to provide an innovative approach to improve reading skills (a component of the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test [FCAT]), utilizing physical education programs, thus providing educators at state and local levels with yet another tool to increase student achievement. The framework for the study was rooted in the relationship between critical thinking and physical education and between critical thinking and critical reading. The reviewed studies indicated that physical activity increases academic achievement, improves health, builds self-esteem, and enhances alertness. The current study provided support for the findings of the California study (California Department of Education [CDE], 2002) and studies on the mind-body connection. It illustrated the effects of the integration of physical activity and critical thinking on the enhancement of academic achievement. It provides a basis for the inclusion of the instructional program into the Miami-Dade County School System's physical education program and provides evidence supporting the importance of physical education in enhancing academic achievement. The Program was administered to 37 fifth-grade students participating in physical education within an elementary school in Miami Gardens, Miami-Dade County, Florida. The elementary school is a kindergarten through Grade 5 School with a multiracial and multicultural student body. The program was conducted daily for 6 weeks within the preexisting physical education program and lasted for 20 minutes each day. A control group of 19 normally educable fifth graders followed the traditional physical education curriculum during this time. Both the control and experimental groups were taught daily during a 5-day week. Tuesdays and Thursdays of each week were utilized to discuss the previous lessons. For the experimental group, the subject matter covered varied daily but consistently required critical thinking to solve basic problems in reading. Some writing was evaluated through take-home assignments. Physical activities were integrated into the daily schedule to complement the subject-matter problems. All students were given a pretest prior to the experimental group entering the program and a posttest upon completion of the program to assess their level of improvement. Utilizing this method, the study was able to show whether a relationship existed between the researcher's strategy and students' improved skills in reading comprehension. An analysis of the data revealed that posttest reading scores, adjusted for pretest scores, for students using the Physio-Cat program were significantly higher than adjusted posttest scores of the control group.

This study examined associations of reduced school exposure via FDSWs with adolescent health and risk behaviors, obesity, and food security. METHODS Self-report data from 8th- and 11th-grade students from the Oregon Healthy Teens survey across 5 survey years (odd years 2007-2015, total N = 91,860-104,108 respondents depending on the survey question) were linked to a FDSW indicator. Regression analyses controlling for student and school characteristics compared outcomes between students in 4- and 5-day schools overall (without school fixed effects) and outcomes associated with switching to a FDSW (with school fixed effects). RESULTS When controlling for multiple student- and school-level factors, we observed adolescents in FDSW schools report they consume sugar sweetened beverages more frequently and water less frequently, have access to fewer days of physical education, are more likely to be food insecure, and are more likely to report the use of any drugs and specifically marijuana than 5-day school week students.

This paper examines the effects of the four-day school week on achievement across 12 states to contextualize these four-day school week impacts nationally. We estimate these effects using a difference-in-differences design with data from the Stanford Educational Data Archive and a proprietary longitudinal national database of four-day school week use from 2009 to 2018. We find reductions in both math and English/language arts achievement when examining four-day school weeks nationally, but these aggregate effects appear to be masking important heterogeneity due to differences in overall time in school across districts. When stratifying four-day week districts into districts with low, middle, and high levels of time in school, we find statistically significant negative effects on math achievement for four-day school week districts with low time in school, but no statistically significant effects for four-day school week districts with middle or high time in school. Our findings suggest that maintaining sufficient overall time in school should be a key consideration for school districts contemplating four-day school week adoption.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 49","Supplemental Search",,

However, the impacts of FDSWs on physical activity exposure and related outcomes are unknown. This study examined physical education (PE) exposure and childhood obesity prevalence in 4- versus 5-day Oregon schools; the authors hypothesized lower PE exposure and higher obesity in FDSW schools, given reduced school environment exposure. METHODS The authors utilized existing data from Oregon to compare 4- versus 5-day models: t tests compared mean school-level factors (PE exposure, time in school, enrollment, and demographics) and complex samples weighted t tests compared mean child-level obesity data for a state representative sample of first to third graders (N = 4625). RESULTS Enrollment, time in school, and student-teacher ratio were significantly lower in FDSW schools. FDSW schools provided significantly more PE, both in minutes (120 vs 101 min/wk in 4- vs 5-d schools, P < .01) and relative to total time in school (6.9% vs 5.0%, P < .0001). Obesity prevalence did not differ significantly between school models. CONCLUSION Greater PE exposure in FDSW schools was observed, and it remains unknown whether differences in PE exposure contributed to obesity prevalence in this sample of students. Efforts to better understand how FDSWs impact physical activity, obesity risk, and related factors are needed.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 48","Supplemental Search",,

(2005a) to use selection on observables to assessthe bias arising from selection on unobservables, imply that Catholic schools do not appreciably boost test scores. All of the empirical strategies point to sizeable negative effects of Catholic schooling on mathematics achievement. Similarly, we find very little evidence that Catholic schooling improves behavioral and other non-cognitive outcomes once we account for selection on unobservables.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3358","Supplemental Search",,
3381,"Marcotte, Dave E.; Hemelt, Steven W.","Unscheduled School Closings and Student Performance.","Do students perform better on statewide assessments in years in which they have more school days to prepare? We explore this question using data on math and reading assessments taken by students in the 3 rd , 5 th and 8 th grades since 1994 in Maryland. Our identification strategy is rooted in the fact that tests are administered on the same day(s) statewide in late winter or early spring, and any unscheduled closings due to snow reduce instruction time, and are not made up until after the exams are over. We estimate that in academic years with an average number of unscheduled closures (5), the number of 3 rd graders performing satisfactorily on state reading and math assessments within a school is nearly 3 percent lower than in years with no school closings. The impacts of closure are smaller for students in 5 th and 8 th grade. Combining our estimates with actual patterns of unscheduled closings in the last 3 years, we find that more than half of schools failing to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) in 3 rd grade math or reading, required under No Child Left Behind, would have met AYP if schools had been open on all scheduled days.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 1662","Supplemental Search",,

This study investigated how achievement tests scores of schools with a four-day school week compared with schools with a traditional five-day school week. The study focused on student performance in Colorado where 62 school districts operated a four-day school week. The results of the Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) were utilized to examine student performance in reading, writing, and mathematics in grades 3 through 10. While the mean test scores for five-day week schools exceeded those of four-day week schools in 11 of the 12 test comparisons, the differences were slight, with only one area revealing a statistically significant difference. This study concludes that decisions to change to the four-day week should be for reasons other than student academic performance.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 101","Supplemental Search",,

Using variation in start times within schools over time, the effect is a two percentile point gain in math test scores – roughly fourteen percent of the black–white test score gap. I find similar results for reading scores and using variation in start times across schools. The effect is stronger for students in the lower end of the distribution of test scores. I find evidence supporting increased sleep as a mechanism through which start times affect test scores. Later start times compare favorably on cost grounds to other education interventions which result in similar test score gains.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 606","Supplemental Search",,

The effect of this federal legislation on the distribution of student achievement is a highly controversial but centrally important question. This study presents evidence on whether NCLB has influenced student achievement based on an analysis of state‐level panel data on student test scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The impact of NCLB is identified using a comparative interrupted time series analysis that relies on comparisons of the test‐score changes across states that already had school accountability policies in place prior to NCLB and those that did not. Our results indicate that NCLB generated statistically significant increases in the average math performance of fourth graders (effect size 5 0.23 by 2007) as well as improvements at the lower and top percentiles. There is also evidence of improvements in eighth‐grade math achievement, particularly among traditionally low‐achieving groups and at the lower percentiles.

Those affected by the policy attend school for the same number of hours each week as students on a typical five-day week; however, treated students do not attend school on Friday. This policy allows us to learn about two aspects of the school-crime relationship that have previously been unstudied: one, the effects of a frequent and permanent schedule change on short-term crime, and two, the impact that school attendance has on youth crime in rural areas. Our difference-in-difference estimates show that following policy adoption, agencies containing students on a four-day week experience about a 20% increase in juvenile criminal offenses, where the strongest effect is observed for property crime.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10","Supplemental Search",,

Findings indicate that student achievement increased at some grade levels, and at other grade levels it was comparable with achievement for previous years. Other outcomes included high levels of student on-task behaviors, less diFruption of instructional time, sustained student engagement, a decrease in employee and student absenteeism, and an approximate 1.6 percent savings in the district budget. However, thz district abandoned the 4-day week after 1 year of implementation.

Through examinations of school calendars and correspondence with school districts, we have compiled the most complete four-day school week dataset to date. We use this unique database to conduct a comprehensive analysis of four-day school week policy adoption and implementation. We find adoption of four-day school weeks is often financially motivated and has generally remained a small, rural district phenomenon. These schedules feature a day off once a week—often Friday—with increased time in school on each of the remaining four school days that, on average, is nearly an hour longer than the national average among five-day schools. Four-day school week schedules average only 148 school days per year, resulting in less time in school than the national average for five-day schools (180 days per year) despite the longer school days. Substantial heterogeneity exists in the structure of these schedules across states, which may help explain differential four-day school week effects on student outcomes across institutional settings in the previous literature.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 51","Supplemental Search",,

This study examined associations of reduced school exposure via FDSWs with adolescent health and risk behaviors, obesity, and food security. METHODS Self-report data from 8th- and 11th-grade students from the Oregon Healthy Teens survey across 5 survey years (odd years 2007-2015, total N = 91,860-104,108 respondents depending on the survey question) were linked to a FDSW indicator. Regression analyses controlling for student and school characteristics compared outcomes between students in 4- and 5-day schools overall (without school fixed effects) and outcomes associated with switching to a FDSW (with school fixed effects). RESULTS When controlling for multiple student- and school-level factors, we observed adolescents in FDSW schools report they consume sugar sweetened beverages more frequently and water less frequently, have access to fewer days of physical education, are more likely to be food insecure, and are more likely to report the use of any drugs and specifically marijuana than 5-day school week students. CONCLUSIONS Limiting exposure to the school environment via FDSWs may impact adolescent health behaviors, including diet, physical activity, and drug use.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3125","Supplemental Search",,

This paper examines the effects of the four-day school week on achievement across 12 states to contextualize these four-day school week impacts nationally. We estimate these effects using a difference-in-differences design with data from the Stanford Educational Data Archive and a proprietary longitudinal national database of four-day school week use from 2009 to 2018. We find reductions in both math and English/language arts achievement when examining four-day school weeks nationally, but these aggregate effects appear to be masking important heterogeneity due to differences in overall time in school across districts. When stratifying four-day week districts into districts with low, middle, and high levels of time in school, we find statistically significant negative effects on math achievement for four-day school week districts with low time in school, but no statistically significant effects for four-day school week districts with middle or high time in school. Our findings suggest that maintaining sufficient overall time in school should be a key consideration for school districts contemplating four-day school week adoption.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3158","Supplemental Search",,

SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on 9 December 2020. We conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""SELECTION CRITERIA"">We considered experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials; RCTs), quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome categories were (i) transmission-related outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of cases); (ii) healthcare utilisation outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of hospitalisations); (iii) other health outcomes (e.g. physical, social and mental health); and (iv) societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. costs, human resources and education). We considered studies that included any population at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and/or developing COVID-19 disease including students, teachers, other school staff, or members of the wider community. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author extracted data and critically appraised each study. One additional review author validated the extracted data. To critically appraise included studies, we used the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental and observational studies, the QUADAS-2 tool for observational screening studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. Three review authors made an initial assessment of the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed and agreed on the ratings.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""MAIN RESULTS"">We included 38 unique studies in the analysis, comprising 33 modelling studies, three observational studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental study with modelling components. Measures fell into four broad categories: (i) measures reducing the opportunity for contacts; (ii) measures making contacts safer; (iii) surveillance and response measures; and (iv) multicomponent measures. As comparators, we encountered the operation of schools with no measures in place, less intense measures in place, single versus multicomponent measures in place, or closure of schools. Across all intervention categories and all study designs, very low- to low-certainty evidence ratings limit our confidence in the findings. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the model structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. Across all categories, few studies reported on implementation or described how measures were implemented. Where we describe effects as 'positive', the direction of the point estimate of the effect favours the intervention(s); 'negative' effects do not favour the intervention. We found 23 modelling studies assessing measures reducing the opportunity for contacts (i.e. alternating attendance, reduced class size). Most of these studies assessed transmission and healthcare utilisation outcomes, and all of these studies showed a reduction in transmission (e.g. a reduction in the number or proportion of cases, reproduction number) and healthcare utilisation (i.e. fewer hospitalisations) and mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 11 modelling studies and two observational studies assessing measures making contacts safer (i.e. mask wearing, cleaning, handwashing, ventilation). Five studies assessed the impact of combined measures to make contacts safer. They assessed transmission-related, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, and a reduction in hospitalisations; however, studies showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 13 modelling studies and one observational study assessing surveillance and response measures, including testing and isolation, and symptomatic screening and isolation. Twelve studies focused on mass testing and isolation measures, while two looked specifically at symptom-based screening and isolation. Outcomes included transmission, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed effects in favour of the intervention in terms of reductions in transmission and hospitalisations, however some showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. fewer number of days spent in school). We found three studies that reported outcomes relating to multicomponent measures, where it was not possible to disaggregate the effects of each individual intervention, including one modelling, one observational and one quasi-experimental study. These studies employed interventions, such as physical distancing, modification of school activities, testing, and exemption of high-risk students, using measures such as hand hygiene and mask wearing. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, however some showed mixed or no effects. As the majority of studies included in the review were modelling studies, there was a lack of empirical, real-world data, which meant that there were very little data on the actual implementation of interventions.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS"">Our review suggests that a broad range of measures implemented in the school setting can have positive impacts on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and on healthcare utilisation outcomes related to COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence for most intervention-outcome combinations is very low, and the true effects of these measures are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Measures implemented in the school setting may limit the number or proportion of cases and deaths, and may delay the progression of the pandemic. However, they may also lead to negative unintended consequences, such as fewer days spent in school (beyond those intended by the intervention). Further, most studies assessed the effects of a combination of interventions, which could not be disentangled to estimate their specific effects. Studies assessing measures to reduce contacts and to make contacts safer consistently predicted positive effects on transmission and healthcare utilisation, but may reduce the number of days students spent at school. Studies assessing surveillance and response measures predicted reductions in hospitalisations and school days missed due to infection or quarantine, however, there was mixed evidence on resources needed for surveillance. Evidence on multicomponent measures was mixed, mostly due to comparators. The magnitude of effects depends on multiple factors. New studies published since the original search date might heavily influence the overall conclusions and interpretation of findings for this review.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

However, the impacts of FDSWs on physical activity exposure and related outcomes are unknown. This study examined physical education (PE) exposure and childhood obesity prevalence in 4- versus 5-day Oregon schools; the authors hypothesized lower PE exposure and higher obesity in FDSW schools, given reduced school environment exposure. METHODS The authors utilized existing data from Oregon to compare 4- versus 5-day models: t tests compared mean school-level factors (PE exposure, time in school, enrollment, and demographics) and complex samples weighted t tests compared mean child-level obesity data for a state representative sample of first to third graders (N = 4625). RESULTS Enrollment, time in school, and student-teacher ratio were significantly lower in FDSW schools. FDSW schools provided significantly more PE, both in minutes (120 vs 101 min/wk in 4- vs 5-d schools, P < .01) and relative to total time in school (6.9% vs 5.0%, P < .0001). Obesity prevalence did not differ significantly between school models. CONCLUSION Greater PE exposure in FDSW schools was observed, and it remains unknown whether differences in PE exposure contributed to obesity prevalence in this sample of students. Efforts to better understand how FDSWs impact physical activity, obesity risk, and related factors are needed.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3212","Supplemental Search",,

Methods Data are from a population-based survey of high-school students. Student responses were weighted to school enrollment, and schools were classified by length of the school week. Indicators of health behaviors and outcomes were compared between the two groups, adjusted for student and school characteristics. Results A 4-day school week was associated with several positive health outcomes (improved student engagement, decreased substance use behaviors, decreased non-school screen time, and increased physical activity) as well as several negative health outcomes (increased bullying, increased sexual activity, decreased sleep, and breakfast consumption). Conclusions Our study found mixed health outcomes associated with attending schools with shortened weeks. The findings may be related to longer school days and a non-contact day, but further research is needed.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3332","Supplemental Search",,

Those affected by the policy attend school for the same number of hours each week as students on a typical five-day week; however, treated students do not attend school on Friday. This policy allows us to learn about two aspects of the school-crime relationship that have previously been unstudied: one, the effects of a frequent and permanent schedule change on short-term crime, and two, the impact that school attendance has on youth crime in rural areas.

Through examinations of school calendars and correspondence with school districts, we have compiled the most complete four-day school week dataset to date. We use this unique database to conduct a comprehensive analysis of four-day school week policy adoption and implementation. We find adoption of four-day school weeks is often financially motivated and has generally remained a small, rural district phenomenon. These schedules feature a day off once a week—often Friday—with increased time in school on each of the remaining four school days that, on average, is nearly an hour longer than the national average among five-day schools. Four-day school week schedules average only 148 school days per year, resulting in less time in school than the national average for five-day schools (180 days per year) despite the longer school days. Substantial heterogeneity exists in the structure of these schedules across states, which may help explain differential four-day school week effects on student outcomes across institutional settings in the previous literature.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3457","Supplemental Search",,

Consequently, the weekend effect on influenza transmission has not been fully explored. To assess whether distinguishing between weekday and weekend transmissions in simulation models of flu-like infectious disease models matters, this study uses an agent-based model of the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. Our study assesses whether including weekend effects is offset by increases in weekend contact patterns and if implementing 3-day weekends dampens disease transmission enough to warrant its use as a containment strategy. Results indicate that ignoring weekend behaviors without incorporating increases in community-based non-school contacts (i.e., compensatory behaviors) causes the peak case incidence day to occur 7 days earlier and can reduce the peak attack rate by as much as 60 %. These results are sensitive to the proportion of symptomatic cases that are assumed to remain at home until they recover. The 3-day weekend intervention has interesting possibilities, but the benefits may only be effective for mild epidemics. However, a 3-day weekend for schools would be less detrimental to the educational process than sustained permanent closing because student and teacher contact is maintained throughout the epidemic period. Also, a 4-day school and work week may be more easily accommodated by many types of schools and businesses. On the other hand, an additional day per week of school closure could result in substantial societal costs, with lost productivity and child care costs outweighing the savings of preventing influenza cases.","duplicate of 489","Update 2 Import",,

We found that an elevated percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness occurred an average of 14 days after schools opened in the fall of 2009. The timing of these events was highly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.62; P<.001). This result provides evidence that transmission in schools catalyzes community-wide transmission.

NPIs, also known as community mitigation measures, are actions that persons and communities can take to help slow the spread of respiratory virus infections, including seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.These guidelines replace the 2007 Interim Pre-pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States - Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425). Several elements remain unchanged from the 2007 guidance, which described recommended NPIs and the supporting rationale and key concepts for the use of these interventions during influenza pandemics. NPIs can be phased in, or layered, on the basis of pandemic severity and local transmission patterns over time. Categories of NPIs include personal protective measures for everyday use (e.g., voluntary home isolation of ill persons, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene); personal protective measures reserved for influenza pandemics (e.g., voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members and use of face masks in community settings when ill); community measures aimed at increasing social distancing (e.g., school closures and dismissals, social distancing in workplaces, and postponing or cancelling mass gatherings); and environmental measures (e.g., routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces).Several new elements have been incorporated into the 2017 guidelines. First, to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs, the latest scientific evidence available since the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 pandemic has been added. Second, a summary of lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response is presented to underscore the importance of broad and flexible prepandemic planning. Third, a new section on community engagement has been included to highlight that the timely and effective use of NPIs depends on community acceptance and active participation. Fourth, to provide new or updated pandemic assessment and planning tools, the novel influenza virus pandemic intervals tool, the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool, the Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework, and a set of prepandemic planning scenarios are described. Finally, to facilitate implementation of the updated guidelines and to assist states and localities with prepandemic planning and decision-making, this report links to six supplemental prepandemic NPI planning guides for different community settings that are available online (https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions).","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3259","Update 2 Import",,

To date, research on school practices to promote social distancing in primary and secondary schools has focused on prolonged school closure, with little attention paid to the identification and feasibility of other more sustainable interventions. To develop a list and typology of school practices that have been proposed and/or implemented in an influenza pandemic and to uncover any barriers identified, lessons learned from their use, and documented impacts. We conducted a review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature on social distancing interventions in schools other than school closure. We also collected state government guidance documents directed to local education agencies or schools to assess state policies regarding social distancing. We collected standardized information from each document using an abstraction form and generated descriptive statistics on common plan elements. The document review revealed limited literature on school practices to promote social distancing, as well as limited incorporation of school practices to promote social distancing into state government guidance documents. Among the 38 states that had guidance documents that met inclusion criteria, fewer than half (42%) mentioned a single school practice to promote social distancing, and none provided any substantive detail about the policies or practices needed to enact them. The most frequently identified school practices were cancelling or postponing after-school activities, canceling classes or activities with a high rate of mixing/contact that occur within the school day, and reducing mixing during transport. Little information is available to schools to develop policies and procedures on social distancing. Additional research and guidance are needed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of school practices to promote social distancing.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3620","Update 2 Import",,

The ongoing 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic has provided an unparalleled opportunity to test interventions with the most up-to-date simulations. METHODS: To assist the Allegheny County Health Department during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the University of Pittsburgh Models of Infectious Disease Agents Study group employed an agent-based computer simulation model (ABM) of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, to explore the effects of various school closure strategies on mitigating influenza epidemics of different reproductive rates (R0). RESULTS: Entire school system closures were not more effective than individual school closures. Any type of school closure may need to be maintained throughout most of the epidemic (ie, at least 8 weeks) to have any significant effect on the overall serologic attack rate. In fact, relatively short school closures (ie, 2 weeks or less) may actually slightly increase the overall attack rate by returning susceptible students back into schools in the middle of the epidemic. Varying the illness threshold at which school closures are triggered did not seem to have substantial impact on the effectiveness of school closures, suggesting that short delays in closing schools should not cause concern. CONCLUSIONS: School closures alone may not be able to quell an epidemic but, when maintained for at least 8 weeks, could delay the epidemic peak for up to a week, providing additional time to implement a second more effective intervention such as vaccination.

Results Of 2579 papers identified through MEDLINE and EMBASE, 65 were eligible for inclusion in the review along with 14 identified from other sources. Influenza incidence frequently declined after school closure. The effect was sometimes reversed when schools reopened, supporting a causal role for school closure in reducing incidence. Any benefits associated with school closure appeared to be greatest among school-aged children. However, as schools often closed late in the outbreak or other interventions were used concurrently, it was sometimes unclear how much school closure contributed to the reductions in incidence.

T.; Fraser, Christophe; Cajka, James; Cooley, Philip C.; Burke, Donald S.","Strategies for mitigating an influenza pandemic","Development of strategies for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures. Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential costs and benefits of different options. Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation to examine intervention options should initial containment of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2-3 weeks unless more than 99% effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up to 40%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50% of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack rates by 40-50%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75%. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ substantially from those seen in past pandemics.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3374","Update 2 Import",,

Other authors proposed using a school week of four or fewer days of in-person instruction for all students to reduce transmission. However, there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of these interventions. Methods We introduced a mathematical model of school outbreaks that considers both intervention methods. Our model accounts for the school structure and schedule, as well as the time-progression of fever symptoms and viral shedding. The model was validated on outbreaks of seasonal and pandemic influenza and COVID-19 in schools. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the proportion of the population infected (attack rate) under the proposed interventions. Results For influenza, the CDC-recommended one day of post-fever isolation can reduce the attack rate by a median (interquartile range) of 29 (13–59)%. With 2 days of post-fever isolation the attack rate could be reduced by 70 (55–85)%. Alternatively, shortening the school week to 4 and 3 days reduces the attack rate by 73 (64–88)% and 93 (91–97)%, respectively.

Therefore, my analysis focuses on students under age 25 to reduce the risk that changes in the characteristics of the study sample drive my findings. First, I show that students in regions subject to stronger enrollment expansions experienced stronger negative shocks to educational inputs, including teacher credentials, per-pupil expenditure, and peer quality. Second, I show that the stronger negative shocks to these inputs coincided with larger increases in course dropout. Taken together, the two sets of results suggest a causal link between educational inputs and students’ academic progress in adult education.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3676","Update 2 Import",,

Yet, no research examines the equity-related effects of NCLB’s district accountability system. Focusing on a state with rich data, we find that negative ratings (which put districts at higher risk of state intervention) led to the disenrollment of economically disadvantaged students (ostensibly leading to a decline in income-based school segregation) and a corresponding (suspicious) jump in test scores. Negative ratings also led to changes in collectively bargained personnel policies and the replacement of teachers in disadvantaged students’ schools. There was no redistribution of funds toward disadvantaged students’ schools, however, and likely minimal impact on district elections. The results put into question whether a shift in district governance helps explain NCLB’s well-documented positive impacts on low-income students’ academic outcomes.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3686","Update 2 Import",,

The effect of female VTE teachers in enrollment in these diplomas reaches 4.0 percentage points, equivalent to an 18% reduction in the observed gender gap.

Second, we review the literature and conduct a meta-analysis of the causal effect of school management interventions on student learning, using 39 estimates from 20 evaluations. We estimate a statistically significant improvement in student learning of 0.033 standard deviations. We show that effect sizes are not related to program scale or intensity. We complement the meta-analysis by identifying common limitations to program effectiveness through a qualitative assessment of the studies included in our review. We find three main factors which mitigate program effectiveness: (1) low take-up; (2) lack of incentives or structure for implementation of recommendations; and (3) the lengthy causal chain linking management practices to student learning. Finally, to assess external validity of our review, we survey practitioners to compare characteristics between evaluated and commonly implemented programs. Our findings suggest that future work should focus on generating evidence on the marginal effect of common design elements in these interventions, including factors that promote school leader engagement and accountability.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3696","Update 2 Import",,

However, admission has a small and insignificant effect on high-income students. The difference between income groups is not explained by educational attainment, program choice, or selection into better-paying jobs. The evidence suggests that most low-income applicants, if not admitted, still graduate from college but with much lower returns to education. High-income applicants who just miss the cutoff, however, can find other opportunities such that earnings trajectories are unchanged.

After reductions in targeted student aid in the late 1980s, high school graduation rates declined by five percentage points on Indian reserves. I suggest that this finding is consistent with a model of human capital acquisition in which the return to a high school degree is low. In this framework, some students complete high school in order to attend a post-secondary institution. When post-secondary education is no longer affordable, some students may no longer find it worthwhile to complete high school. In the long-run, the program cutbacks had lasting adverse effects on labour supply.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3701","Update 2 Import",,

In this article, I combine satellite data on fire radiative power with an individual-level panel dataset to estimate the short-term and long-term impact of forest fires on human capital in rural Nepal. Using a fixed effects panel regression approach, I find that a one standard deviation increase in fire radiative power from last year’s forest fires is associated with a 1.06 percentage point decline in the likelihood of completing middle school. Results indicate that a one standard deviation increase in fire radiative power from fires 6–10 years ago leads to a 6.34 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of completing middle school, implying that the impact of environmental shocks on educational outcomes can be larger in the long run. Subsequent analysis indicates that a yearly lagged fire radiative power exacerbates disparities in middle school completion between individuals that attend government schools and those that attend private schools. While the effects of fires on self-reported measures of health outcomes and absenteeism in school are statistically insignificant, individuals report an increase in worry about inadequate food and scholarships in response to a one standard deviation increase in fire radiative power from last year’s forest fires. These findings support the hypothesis that natural disasters lead to economic damage and food insecurity that, in turn, result in disinvestment in school supplies, higher grade repetition and lower likelihood of middle school completion in the developing world.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3707","Update 2 Import",,

However, this effect diminishes over time and becomes negative (-10 percent of a standard deviation) if students spend several years in a multigrade class. Mechanism analysis indicates the fundamental role of teachers and suggests that the negative long-term effect of multigrading is not statistically different from zero when multigrade classes are taught by more experienced teachers.

While the reform increased the length of schooling, it did not decrease the probability of dropping out of secondary school, either on average or among the most at-risk group of Roma ethnic minority students. Due to grade retentions, marginal students were older than their peers and couldn't have reached the final grade of secondary school by age 18 to earn a degree. The reform also did not affect the probability of employment, hours worked, wages and the probability of working in low-skilled occupations at ages 20 and 25.

In this paper, I study the effects of eligibility limits in the context of the Universal Primary Education (UPE) reform in Uganda. The program abolished elementary school fees for up to four children per household, with families paying fees on each additional child. Depending on the composition of children and their age at the onset of the reform, the policy generates costs for primary school that vary both within and across households. Children that are eligible for the tuition waiver but live in households with ineligible siblings complete fewer years of schooling. I estimate that the presence of ineligible siblings wiped out almost half of the overall impact of the UPE reform on educational attainment, with the effects concentrated among the poorest households. Household responses to the subsidy program are similar to those found in other types of schooling programs such as conditional cash transfers.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3729","Update 2 Import",,

In most countries, entitlement to regular UI hinges on completing a qualifying period of work and social contributions. In Belgium, this requirement also exists but is relaxed for education-leavers in that they can substitute time actively searching for a job for employment during the qualifying period. We evaluate the impact on degree completion and dropout of a 2015 reform that withdrew this weaker requirement from graduates aged 25 or over and from high school dropouts younger than 21. We find that the reform significantly increased degree completion and reduced dropout for students in higher education but not for those in high school.

Many times, these gaps are measured using low-stakes tests that are especially sensitive to motivation and test engagement. I conduct a field experiment in 7 Israeli Jewish and Arab middle schools and use data from PISA 2015 to investigate whether part of the performance gaps between ethnic minority and majority groups could be attributed to test engagement rather than proficiency. I find that test engagement can account for more than 50% of the performance gaps measured in low-stakes assessments. Test engagement is also important, as it correlates with several personality traits important to life outcomes. Therefore, considering the importance of both test engagement, which influences low-stakes assessments, and proficiency, which is more accurately discerned in high-stakes assessments, policymakers should make deliberate decisions regarding the stakes assigned to assessment tests, taking into account the specific evaluation criteria that they aim to emphasize.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3731","Update 2 Import",,

The primary drivers of this advancement – infrastructure, teaching and learning evaluations, faculty dedication, and the proportion of faculty with a Ph.D. degree – are largely under the administrators’ direct control.

I use difference-in-differences and event study models to identify effects on theoretically related school- and district-level mechanisms as well as long-term youth outcomes. In contexts where districts consolidate, per-pupil expenditures on instruction and district support services decrease, and schools become more racially integrated. However, youth exposed to mergers are no more likely to be convicted of a crime in early adulthood than those unexposed. These null effects hold when looking at conviction rates by race and by type of crime and when analyzing another key outcome, educational attainment. My results thus provide causal evidence confirming prior research suggesting that consolidation may: 1) reduce the operational costs of schools without negatively affecting students, and 2) support efforts to address persistent racial isolation between schools.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3735","Update 2 Import",,

While some early work, e.g. Dee (2004) finds education induces more socially-liberal views, more recent works suggests that education makes individuals more fiscally conservative. We use quasi-experimental variation in schooling created by compulsory schooling laws (CSLs) to reconcile these results. Following Marshall (2019), we first examine a pooled sample of voter and find that policy-induced increases in education lead to voters being more likely to identify as, and vote for, Republican candidates, largely due to concerns regarding taxes. Delving further into this result, however, we find highly heterogeneous impacts of education, which depend on the efficacy of CSLs. In particular, in states where CSLs significantly increased educational attainment, impacted individuals become more fiscally conservative, but also exhibit greater support for traditional Democratic social issues like abortion rights and environmental protection, creating so-called “Rockefeller” Republicans. By contrast, voters educated in states where CSLs have no measured impact on educational attainment exhibit generally more conservative attitudes toward non-economics and social issues, which are traits that are consistent with so-called “Goldwater” Republicans.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3740","Update 2 Import",,

In so doing, we exploit the variation across levels of education in the implementation of free compulsory education laws in Nigeria. Estimation results show that fifteen months after schools reopened, COVID-19’s containment measures had no permanent effect on the school attendance of children whose schooling was free and compulsory. However, they decreased the school attendance of those whose schooling was neither free nor compulsory by 7.8 percentage points.

We show that the communities in which turnaround schools are located were hardest hit by the pandemic and school and district operations were substantially disrupted. By extension, turnaround districts and especially the lowest performing schools in those districts that were targeted for school-level turnaround experienced high rates of student absenteeism, low student and parent engagement, and, ultimately, significantly smaller gains on math and reading benchmark assessments than non-turnaround districts.

The estimates focus on the early career paths of graduates who obtained a master's degree between 2010 and 2017. As direct information on social contacts is not available in the dataset, we proxy university peers as students who started and finished the same university programmes (bachelor's or master's) in the same semester. Our results suggest that individuals are more likely to get hired by given firms if their former peers work there. The measured effects are considered significant and quite robust, even after controlling for the important sources of potential bias. Although we cannot present exact proof of the direct help of contacts, we provide suggestive evidence that seems to confirm the existence of such assistance. Our findings also revealed that the measured benefits are mainly attributable to connections from bachelor's studies. The effect of master's peers is mostly driven by the selection of individuals alongside prevalent study track-firm pathways. By comparing entries into new firms with and without peers, we also show that graduates with links have better labor market outcomes after hiring: they earn higher wages, obtain better and more prestigious positions, and stay longer at their new firm. The results draw attention to the importance of university peers in the labour market and contribute to the discussions about the determinants of early labour market success.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3750","Update 2 Import",,

We show that the expansion of universal childcare and, more recently, the increased teacher-pupil ratio in compulsory school, have disproportionally benefited lower class offspring. The rising influence of parents’ earnings rank can partly be explained by a strengthened intragenerational association between earnings rank and education among parents, as educational achievement has an inheritable component.

The main findings are: (1) Black–White dissimilarity fell sharply in the late 1960s and early 1970s and has fallen more gradually since then. White students' exposure to Black students rose almost continuously from 1968 through 2011 before declining somewhat in recent years. Meanwhile, Black students' exposure to White students increased sharply in the late 1960s and early 1970s and has fluctuated since. (2) There has been regional convergence, although colleges in the South remain more segregated than those in any other region when measured by dissimilarity or by Black students' exposure to White students. (3) A major channel for the decline in segregation is the declining share of Black students attending historically Black colleges and universities. Differences in which U.S. state students attend college play only a small role in creating segregation, and there is moderate evidence that segregation is related to college selectivity stratification by race.

We find that a 1 standard deviation increase in reports of state-level hate crimes predicts a 17 to 22 percent increase in Black first-time student enrollment at historically Black colleges and universities. As the number of reported hate crimes is almost assuredly an undercount of the actual number of incidents, we explore the implications of what these results mean.</jats:p>","duplicate of 3801","Update 2 Import",,

If structured gap time shapes educational outcomes, increasing the uptake of gap time by women may be a mechanism to ameliorate later wage gaps. Using administrative data from Brigham Young University (N = 17,402) and an instrumental variables estimation strategy, we find that women who take gap time for missionary service shift into majors with higher expected salaries and are more likely to be in limited-enrollment majors and majors with a higher concentration of men. However, gap time decreases the likelihood of graduating within eight years of entering college, creating tension between the costs and benefits. On average, net benefits of expected wages are close to zero. Gap time most clearly benefits women with relatively low ACT scores who are more likely to be accepted into limited enrollment programs following gap time. This research informs university administrators and students alike seeking to understand the academic implications of taking planned time off during postsecondary education.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3808","Update 2 Import",,

Evidence suggests that a common perverse effect of exit exams is an increase in dropout for students who have difficulty passing tests, with a larger effect on minority students. To mitigate this, some states offer alternative, non-tested pathways to graduation for students who have failed their exit exams. This study investigates the post-secondary effects of an alternative high school graduation program. Compared with similar students who fail to complete high school, those students who take the alternative pathway have better post-secondary outcomes in both education and employment. Compared with similar students who retake exit exams to graduate, those who eventually graduate through an alternative project-based pathway have lower college enrollment, but similar employment outcomes.</jats:p>","duplicate of 3810","Update 2 Import",,

Because natural disasters induce community-wide stress, students who experience natural disasters may subsequently perform worse academically. Our study is the first to examine the immediate effects of close exposure to a natural disaster on academic performance. We examine the impact of the 2017 Pohang earthquake in South Korea on college entrance exam scores. The 5.4 magnitude quake occurred one day before the scheduled nationwide college entrance exam date, necessitating its postponement for one week. Several aftershocks occurred during that postponement period. We find that the earthquake decreased the reading test scores of students in the Pohang area by 0.05 standard deviation but had no effect on math test scores. The reading test was administered earlier in the day than the math test, so these findings suggest that students taking exams in post-traumatic situations might be able to perform better after a warm-up testing period. Finally, male students suffered the largest adverse impacts on their reading test scores, with serious implications given the high-stakes nature of the exams.</jats:p>","duplicate of 3814","Update 2 Import",,

In this analysis, we link data on these teacher candidates to unemployment insurance data in the state to provide a descriptive portrait of the future earnings and wages of these individuals inside and outside of public schools. Candidates who initially became public school teachers earned considerably more, on average, than candidates who were initially employed either in other education positions or in other sectors of the state's workforce. These differences persisted ten years into the average career and across transitions into and out of teaching. There is therefore little evidence that teacher candidates who did not become teachers were lured into other professions by higher compensation. Instead, the patterns are consistent with demand-side constraints on teacher hiring during this time period that resulted in individuals who wanted to become teachers taking positions that offered lower wages but could lead to future teaching positions.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3819","Update 2 Import",,

We study a modern mode of school-based health care, telemedicine, that offers the potential to reach places and populations with historically low access to such care. School-based telemedicine clinics (SBTCs) provide students with access to health care during the regular school day through private videoconferencing with a health care provider. We exploit variation over time in SBTC openings across schools in three rural districts in North Carolina. We find that school-level SBTC access reduces the likelihood that a student is chronically absent by 2.5 percentage points (29 percent) and reduces the number of days absent by about 0.8 days (10 percent). Relatedly, access to an SBTC increases the likelihood of math and reading test-taking by between 1.8 and 2.0 percentage points (about 2 percent). Heterogeneity analyses suggest that these effects are driven by male students. Finally, we see suggestive evidence that SBTC access reduces violent or weapons-related disciplinary infractions among students but has little influence on other forms of misbehavior.</jats:p>","duplicate of 3820","Update 2 Import",,

Because most data on school district pension expenditures are at the state level, it has so far been difficult to assess what changes local school districts have made in response. In this paper, I analyze a new dataset of the annual pension expenditures of approximately 200 unified school districts across the United States from 2005 to 2016. Consistent with findings in the literature, I find that pension expenditures rose in real terms in most of them, but also that there has been significant variation in that growth. Moreover, in a descriptive analysis, I find that larger within-district pension expenditure growth is associated with (1) greater revenue growth in the subsequent year and (2) reductions in school district employment, mainly through reductions in the number of non-teaching staff. Finally, there is evidence that districts’ responses to rising pension expenditures may depend on state political institutions, in particular whether the states have mandatory collective bargaining for teachers.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3824","Update 2 Import",,

Better college football team performance during the early years of school attendance increases average wages of male students, but does not impact female wages. Supplemental evidence suggests that positive shocks to student social networks may partly explain the positive impact on earnings.

In Intervention 1, treated students receive an invitation letter with or without information about a past sign-up rate for the course. In Intervention 2, among those who signed up for the course, treated students receive reminder letters including or excluding information on how helpful the course had been evaluated by previous students. On average, no treatment increases participation in the course, but further analyses reveal that the effects in Intervention 1 are heterogeneous along two dimensions: First, suggesting salience as a mechanism, both types of information raise attendance among students who enroll late in their study program, which in turn increases their first-year performance and closes the achievement gap to early enrollees. Second, the effect of the letter with information about the past sign-up rate depends on the predicted ex-ante sign-up probability. Students whose probability falls just short of the past sign-up rate increase sign-up and participation, while the opposite is true for students whose sign-up probability exceeds the social information. Along this dimension, however, the changes in attendance do not carry over to academic achievements.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3829","Update 2 Import",,

As school ranking depends on the institution's relative position according to a set of variables and their corresponding thresholds, we use a multivariate regression discontinuity design to evaluate the impact of the policy on teacher mobility. Our findings reveal that teachers are generally more likely to leave low-performing schools, although this result varies by type of management. Teachers in public schools tend to transfer to other schools within the system, and those who do so are more likely to be working in two or more schools. Meanwhile, teachers in private schools are comparatively more likely to exit the system altogether, with mobility concentrated among low-productivity teachers. Despite these differences, the introduction of accountability did not induce new hires at either type of school.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3833","Update 2 Import",,

Enrolling in a charter school increased eleventh-grade standardized test scores and enrollment and persistence in four-year colleges substantially, but had no effect on high school GPA. Charter students took more advanced coursework, were less likely to skip class, were more likely to apply to a four-year college, and reported more teacher support for college-going. The increase in four-year persistence appears to be driven by more enrollment and persistence in University of California campuses, which have higher graduation rates than the likely alternatives. This suggests that the effects of charter schools could depend on the availability of high graduation rate colleges.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3836","Update 2 Import",,

Centralized college admissions simplify the application process and reduce students' informational barriers. However, such systems also reward informed and strategic college choices. In particular, centralized admissions can be difficult to navigate because they require students to understand how application portfolios and placement priorities map to admission probabilities. Using administrative data from one of the poorest provinces in China, I document that students made undermatched college choices that correlated with inaccurate predictions of admission probabilities. I then implemented a large-scale randomized experiment (N= 32,834) to provide treated students with either (a) an application guidebook or (b) a guidebook plus a school workshop. Results suggest that informing students on choosing colleges and majors based on precise predictions of admission probabilities can effectively improve student–college academic match by 0.1 to 0.2 standard deviation among compliers without substantially changing their college-major preferences.</jats:p>","duplicate of 3837","Update 2 Import",,

The Role of Evaluation and the Impact of Exiting Low-Performing Teachers","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Historically, teacher evaluation systems have identified few teachers as low-performing and needing improvement. In 2012, at the beginning of a national reform movement, Chicago Public Schools implemented its overhauled evaluation system, which incorporated multiple measures of teaching practice and dismissal plans for low-rated teachers. We find that the reform increased the exit rate of low-rated tenured teachers by 50 percent. At the same time, the teachers who replaced the exited teachers were significantly higher-performing. Ultimately, the accountability function of the reformed teacher evaluation policy resulted in higher teaching quality. However, the policy impact was limited because very few teachers received low ratings under the reformed system. Policy simulation results suggest that the available teacher labor supply is likely sufficient to set a higher standard for satisfactory teaching.</jats:p>","duplicate of 3839","Update 2 Import",,

Using administrative data on Massachusetts public school students, I use a triple difference strategy to estimate impacts on special education setting, attendance, suspensions and achievement. I find that ARICA increased inclusion for students with ASD; they were 4 percentage points more likely to be fully included after the reform. Further, days suspended decreased by about 26 percent, and the likelihood of receiving a suspension decreased by about 2 percentage points. I find that improvements in student outcomes were larger for students in grades 6–8 (versus elementary students). While I find no statistically significant improvement in test scores for students with ASD overall, math (English language arts) achievement increased by 0.09 (0.13) standard deviation for students in middle grades.</jats:p>","duplicate of 3840","Update 2 Import",,

Districts serving economically disadvantaged communities tend to receive lower credit ratings and pay higher interest rates. To remedy this problem, twenty-four states have established credit enhancement programs that promise to repay district debt when a district cannot do so, thereby enhancing the district's credit rating. With a generalized difference-in-differences approach, I rely on cross- and within-district variations to estimate the effect of state enhancement on district bond interest rate, per-pupil capital spending, and student performance. State enhancement reduces district bond interest rates by 6 percent and increases per-student capital spending by 2 percent to 7 percent. It also reduces the disparity in the interest rate and capital spending across districts serving lower- and higher-income families, with no discernible effect on test scores. I find no evidence that the amount of enhanced school debt is associated with significant changes in interest rates paid by state governments. Districts in states without such programs could have achieved cost savings in the range of $383 million to $1 billion from 2009 to 2019 had the states adopted similar programs.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3841","Update 2 Import",,

In this brief, we describe existing federal efforts to support education spending in high-poverty districts, discuss their limitations, and suggest alternative approaches for federal policy. We focus especially on the Education Finance Incentive Grant (EFIG) formula—a part of the compensatory Title I grant program designed to encourage changes to state school finance policy—and show that the incentives embedded in the formula are in fact negligible; revising the formula to be more effective would be difficult. Further, any attempt to incentivize desirable state policy faces a fundamental trade-off: Such policy can reinforce inequality because districts in states that do not respond to the incentives by adopting desirable policies also do not receive (as much) federal funding. We argue that federal policy should be more attentive to state fiscal capacity because it is an important determinant of district-level school spending, and the federal government is uniquely positioned to address between-state inequality.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3842","Update 2 Import",,

Prior research has not disentangled whether these disparities are due to differential sorting into colleges and majors, or due to barriers that lower socioeconomic status (SES) graduates encounter during the college-to-career transition. Using linked individual-level higher education and Unemployment Insurance records for nearly a decade of students from the Virginia Community College System, we compare the labor market outcomes of higher and lower SES community college graduates within the same college, program, and academic performance level. Our analyses show that, conditional on employment, lower SES graduates earn nearly $500/quarter less than their higher SES peers one year after graduation, relative to higher SES graduate average of $10,846/quarter. The magnitude of this disparity persists through at least three years after graduation. Disparities are concentrated among non-nursing programs, in which gaps persist seven years from graduation.

Focusing on the years with the best available data, 2014–18, we find that the annual closure rate of charter, private, and traditional public schools (TPSs) were 5.1, 2.9, and 0.9 percent, respectively. The annual restructuring rates are 2.0 percent for charter schools and 0.6 percent for TPSs. Regression analysis shows that these differences in closure and restructuring rates by sector drop slightly after controlling for student and school characteristics. The strongest predictor of increased closures is low student enrollment, especially in private schools. In charter and traditional public schools, achievement measures predict closure and restructuring nearly as strongly as enrollment. While racial and income composition are weaker predictors of closure/restructuring, that they predict at all, after controlling for many other factors, raises some equity concerns. We also discuss ways in which the forces behind closure/restructuring may be difficult to uncover with this type of quantitative analysis.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3849","Update 2 Import",,

This paper evaluates the contribution of G&amp;T education to racial segregation using data on the presence and racial composition of G&amp;T programs at virtually all U.S. elementary schools over a span of nine school years. I first show that, consistent with widespread perceptions, G&amp;T programs do disproportionately enroll white and Asian students while black, Hispanic, and Native American students are underrepresented. Next, I calculate the changes in the Dissimilarity and Exposure Indices that occur when G&amp;T programs are treated as fully separate schools, which provides a transparent measure of their contribution to overall racial segregation. These calculations indicate that accounting for the within-school racial sorting caused by G&amp;T education increases the Dissimilarity Index by 10 to 20 percent, and has little to no impact on the Exposure Index. Finally, to study the potential effects of G&amp;T programs on enrollments over time, I estimate event study models for schools initiating or discontinuing G&amp;T programs, and find no large changes in white or Asian enrollment after programs are eliminated or initiated. I conclude that G&amp;T education's impact on racial segregation in U.S. elementary schools is modest, although changes in G&amp;T programming could still be one meaningful tool to increase integration.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3852","Update 2 Import",,

It is important for pre-service teachers to receive feedback on specific classroom management strategies from their trainers (supervisor and cooperating teacher), using an observation tool and ideally a video recording of their practice. Yet little is known about the evolution of pre-service teachers' actual classroom management practices during their internships and the feedback they receive from their trainers. This article therefore presents the evolution of the actual practices of pre-service French-speaking Belgian teachers observed on two occasions during their internships (Observation 1 and Observation 2). It also presents the link between the feedback given by the trainers and the intentions to act expressed by the pre-service teacher during the debriefing following the first observation (O1) and the strategies implemented by the pre-service teachers during the second observation (O2). To this end, an observation grid inserted into an observation software was used live in secondary school classrooms, and the debriefings were recorded and then analyzed. By comparing the feedback and intentions to act expressed during the debriefings with the actual strategies of the pre-service teachers, it was possible to identify which feedback and intentions to act were actually implemented by the pre-service teachers, on the basis of observable indicators. The results point to a number of positive developments in pre-service teachers' practices, and indicate certain avenues for improvement. They also show that pre-service teachers followed half the feedback given to them by their trainers. The results provide a basis for formulating ways of training teachers in effective classroom management.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3862","Update 2 Import",,

Effects of four-day school weeks on physical education exposure and childhood obesity.","Reports an error in ""Effects of four-day school weeks on physical education exposure and childhood obesity"" by Emily J. Tomayko, Katherine B. Gunter, John M. Schuna Jr. and Paul N. Thompson (Journal of Physical Activity & Health, 2020[Sep], Vol 17[9], 902-906). In the original article, the authors obtained a CC BY open access license, and the article was republished online as open access with the corrected copyright notice. The article was corrected July 19, 2023. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-70982-007). Background: Use of 4-day school weeks (FDSWs) as a cost-saving strategy has increased substantially as many US school districts face funding declines. However, the impacts of FDSWs on physical activity exposure and related outcomes are unknown. This study examined physical education (PE) exposure and childhood obesity prevalence in 4-versus 5-day Oregon schools; the authors hypothesized lower PE exposure and higher obesity in FDSW schools, given reduced school environment exposure. Methods: The authors utilized existing data from Oregon to compare 4-versus 5-day models: t tests compared mean school-level factors (PE exposure, time in school, enrollment, and demographics) and complex samples weighted t tests compared mean child-level obesity data for a state representative sample of first to third graders (N = 4625). Results: Enrollment,time in school, and student–teacher ratio were significantly lower in FDSW schools. FDSW schools provided significantly more PE, both in minutes (120 vs 101 min/wk in 4- vs 5-d schools, P P < .0001). Obesity prevalence did not differ significantly between school models. Conclusion: Greater PE exposure in FDSW schools was observed, and it remains unknown whether differences in PE exposure contributed to obesity prevalence in this sample of students. Efforts to better understand how FDSWs impact physical activity, obesity risk, and related factors are needed.

Early literacy and numeracy skills are essential functions that provide the basis for success in the American public education system and a global economy. Any school schedule that adversely affects mastery of these essential functions in early grades put students' success at unnecessary risk. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a statistically significant difference in primary grade student achievement existed between four-day per week schools and five-day per week schools. Northwest Evaluation Association Measure of Academic Progress (MAP) and Measure of Academic Progress for Primary Grades (MPG) was used to measure the reading and mathematics achievement of students in first through third grades in Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming. This study was conducted because a careful review of related literature revealed that the impact of the four-day per week school schedule on student achievement in primary grades had not been conducted. A matched-pairs design was employed in this study and paired-samples t-tests were conducted to address the research questions that guided this study. Schools were matched based on the state in which the schools were located, the grade-level enrollment of each school, and the free and reduced lunch data from each school. In addition to determining the impact on student achievement the impact of the four-day per week schedule on average daily attendance was examined. All schools in the study were required to use the MAP or MPG to assess student achievement. For all matched pairs the students in five-day per week schools reported higher mean RIT scores than the students in four-day per week schools, however, the only statistically significant difference identified was in second grade reading and mathematics scores. The effect size of the four-day per week school schedule varied from .23 to .68.

On average, we find minimal differences between 3rd grade test scores of four-day and five-day students, but there are notable differential effects across the spectrum of these students’ kindergarten readiness scores and educational program participation. We find that above median performers on kindergarten assessments, White students, general education students, and gifted students—student groups that make up more than half our sample—are the most negatively impacted by the four-day school week during the early elementary period. We generally find no statistically significant evidence of detrimental four-day school week achievement impacts for students who were below median performers on kindergarten assessments, minority students, economically disadvantaged students, special education participants, and English as a second language students.

METHODS: This 2-year, prepost study compared student overall average and final examination scores and overall course grades after the transition from a 5-day to a 4-day week of an integrated learning experience (ILE) course sequence. In addition, an anonymous, optional 23-item survey was distributed to first to third year pharmacy students asking about the 4-day week change, how they utilized the non-ILE day, and additional demographic and social characteristics to identify factors influencing success on examination and course performance during the 4-day week.  RESULTS: There were 533 students included in the overall analysis, with no significant differences in overall course grades in the 5-day vs 4-day week. Examination scores were not significantly different after the transition, except in 2 of 12 courses where scores were higher and final examination scores were not significantly different, except for higher final examination scores in 1 course during the 5-day week. Significant positive influencers of top quartile of examination performance included prepharmacy grade point average ≥ 3.5, age 25 to 29 years, and prepharmacy coursework at the parent institution, whereas using the non-ILE day primarily to sleep negatively influenced outcomes.  CONCLUSION: Curricular density is a prevalent problem and addressing it at a program level is essential. Reducing curricular content and hours at our institution did not adversely impact student examination and course performance and slight improvement was noted in some areas.

Objective  We hypothesized that sleepiness would be higher in an 8 a.m. versus 10 a.m. section of Introductory Psychology, and grades, engagement, enjoyment, attendance, assignment completion, ease of waking and staying awake, and student evaluations of teaching (SETs) would be lower.  Method  Eighty-two students enrolled in an 8 a.m. (n = 39) or 10 a.m. (n = 43) section of Introductory Psychology reported their GPA and completed the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, Likert-scale items from the College’s SET form, and other questions.  Results  Students in the 8 a.m. section reported lower GPA, class grade, and assignments completed; more sleepiness; and a harder time waking up and staying awake for class. Several findings held when controlling for GPA.  Conclusion  Results extend previous research and suggest the importance of offering later classes in college. Limitations include a small sample size, quasi-experimental design, and use of self-report data. Future researchers should test whether findings replicate with other kinds of classes and in other subjects.

Essays on the four-day school week.","Four-day school weeks have proliferated across the United States in recent years, affecting over 650 public school districts in 24 states as of 2019, but very little is known about their implementation or their effects on students. Policies enabling four-day school weeks are disputed by many state legislatures: Oklahoma, for example, is currently debating financial savings and achievement metrics that districts must meet to continue to use a four-day school week beyond the 2020-2021 school year. Historically, districts adopting four-day weeks have been motivated by potential financial savings and located primarily in poor, rural areas. However, a broader range of districts have recently turned to four-day weeks in response to challenges related to COVID-19 (Altavena, 2020). Given the recent growth of four-day school weeks, the relevant ongoing legislation, and their use in response to COVID-19, research on the implementation and effects of this policy is unprecedentedly salient and consequential. The three chapters comprising this dissertation provide novel evidence regarding the implementation and effects of the four-day school week. The first two chapters employ rigorous quantitative methodology to estimate causal impacts of the schedule on school finance, achievement, attendance, and student behavior. The third chapter leverages a mixed-methods approach to describe the implementation of the four-day week in terms of the differences in students' experiences and time use on four- and five-day week schedules. Taken together, the three chapters provide insights for policymakers and practitioners regarding the potential advantages and disadvantages of adopting a four-day week. In the following sections, I provide additional background on the four-day school week policy, describe my theoretical framework, discuss the prior literature on four-day school weeks, and provide an overview of each of the three papers in the dissertation. Background State policies that enable four-day school weeks typically require districts to meet a minimum number of instructional hours without mandating a minimum number of instructional days. To implement a four-day week, districts typically increase the length of the weekdays they are in school and have Fridays or Mondays off, the ""fifth day."" A survey of a national sample of four-day districts finds that, on the fifth day, nearly half are completely closed or offer no student services and less than one third offer any sort of activity to students with any frequency (Thompson et al., 2020). Weekly changes in students' time use in school and out of school and how and where students spend their time on the fifth day remain unknown. Originating as early as the 1930s in South Dakota, the schedule is not an entirely new phenomenon, but it has seen unprecedented growth in its adoption over the past two decades, increasing from 257 schools across 108 districts in 1999 to 1,607 schools across 662 school districts in 24 states in 2019 (Thompson et al., 2020). The most common rationale for adoption is financial savings, which districts argue are primarily realized by reducing transportation and utility costs by not operating busses and not heating the school building, for example, on the fifth day. In addition to financial concerns, districts switching to a four-day schedule also cite other reasons for adopting the schedule, including attendance-related issues (e.g., low attendance rates, missing school for appointments or athletics) and issues related to being in a rural area (e.g., long bus rides, time to work on family farms and ranches, student/teacher retention). However, all of these rationales have limited, if any, empirical support to date. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)","duplicate of 4570","Update 3 Import",,

It is believed that drug-associated memories maintain compulsive drug-seeking behavior. Therefore, disrupting drug-associated memories may reduce drug-seeking behavior. In the present study, a conditioned place preference (CPP) apparatus was conducted to evaluate the effect of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) agonist and antagonist on the acquisition of CPP induced by methamphetamine (METH). Anxiety behaviors and memory retrieval were assessed using elevated plus maze (EPM) and step-through passive avoidance tasks. In this study using a 5-day schedule of CPP, exposure to METH increased the time spent in the drug-paired compartment, and CB1Rs agonist (WIN 55,212-2, WIN) disrupted the METH-induced CPP. In the EPM experiment, METH significantly decreased the ratio of times spent in the open arms to total times spent in any arms (OAT) and the ratio of entries into open arms to total entries (OAE), indicating that METH increases anxiety-like behaviors. However, the CB1Rs antagonist (SR141716A, SR) reversed METH-induced anxiety behaviors. The results obtained in the passive avoidance experiment showed that blockade of brain CB1Rs by SR improves METH-induced amnesia. In summary, CB1Rs appear to modulate METH-associated memories, and antagonists of CB1Rs may serve as a therapeutic target for METH-induced anxiety behaviors.

The current study sought to explore if students in Australia, Greece, Iran, and Qatar differed in their experience of school belonging and to establish common and unique practices students voiced as improving their sense of belonging. Cross-country responses from 698 secondary school students (from Australia, Greece, Iran, and Qatar) were analysed using both quantitative (ANOVA) and qualitative (thematic analysis) methods. Iranian students reported significantly higher school belonging than their Australian, Greek, and Qatari counterparts, while Qatari students also scored higher than those from Australia and Greece. Common teacher- and school-level belonging practices were established from the student responses, and cross-country differences are discussed. The study underscores the importance of cultural sensitivity and student involvement in crafting context-specific strategies to enhance school belonging for optimal student wellbeing and success.

Despite significant reforms to improve animal welfare in accredited zoos and aquariums across North America, and significant participation in animal conservation efforts globally, these attacks persist. If zoos are to continue long-term, they need to establish themselves as community resources. One way that zoos can act as community resources are as resources for science education. For zoos to establish themselves as educational resources, there first must be evidence that zoos are positively impacting the education of their visitors. To date, however, the published research is limited and the most prominent research claiming to verify the educational impact of zoos has been highly criticized. Most research on zoo education to date has focused on the education of visitors during informal zoo visits. There is even less research regarding formal zoo education programming that typically occurs during school field trips. Research investigating how current programming designed to help elementary school students learn science through a five-day school field trip would help both zoos and elementary educators understand how students learned, and what impacted learning during participation in this program. The research outlined in this dissertation helps to answer these questions through an investigation of the BIG Zoo Lesson (BZL). A case study design was used for this research because it provided an appropriate approach to understand a complex situation with several different sets of data. A total of 9 teachers and their 48 students were interviewed both before and after their participation in the BZL and observed during the five school days they spent using a zoo as their classroom. These observations included scripted observations of lessons and activities, and direct observations of selected students during their daily one-hour animal observations. Additionally, students' BZL journals were digitally scanned, producing 2628 images of student artifacts. From the cross-referenced analysis of this data, several conclusions were made. First, the BZL facilitated active STEM learning by upper elementary students. Students appeared highly engaged during these learning experiences and appeared to both gain and retain some understanding of the science concepts in these lessons. Second, learning recorded by students through student artifacts during the BZL was retained at greater rates than learning not recorded for upper elementary students. Lastly, proximity to and observation of live animals during the BZL facilitated engagement in learning for upper elementary students. It appeared that this engagement led to greater understanding and retention of conceptual knowledge. Parent chaperone behavior during daily one-hour observation periods appeared to impact student learning by impacting engagement and on-task behavior during daily one-hour animal observations. The use of activities during daily one-hour animal observations not designed to task students with conducting independent investigations utilizing science practices may have impacted student identification of their own observations as learning. Overall, the design of the BZL provided learning experiences for upper elementary students utilizing live animals and animal artifacts not available to typical elementary teachers. The use of these resources facilitated engaging active learning experiences that positively impacted student learning. The insights from this research can help to improve learning experiences for all BZL participants and inform program design for zoo educational field trips, thereby helping zoos establish themselves as community educational resources.

In addition to financial concerns, districts switching to a four-day schedule also cite other reasons for adopting the schedule, including attendance-related issues (e.g., low attendance rates, missing school for appointments or athletics) and issues related to being in a rural area (e.g., long bus rides, time to work on family farms and ranches, student/teacher retention). However, all of these rationales have limited, if any, empirical support to date.

Early literacy and numeracy skills are essential functions that provide the basis for success in the American public education system and a global economy. Any school schedule that adversely affects mastery of these essential functions in early grades put students' success at unnecessary risk. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a statistically significant difference in primary grade student achievement existed between four-day per week schools and five-day per week schools. Northwest Evaluation Association Measure of Academic Progress (MAP) and Measure of Academic Progress for Primary Grades (MPG) was used to measure the reading and mathematics achievement of students in first through third grades in Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming. This study was conducted because a careful review of related literature revealed that the impact of the four-day per week school schedule on student achievement in primary grades had not been conducted. A matched-pairs design was employed in this study and paired-samples t-tests were conducted to address the research questions that guided this study. Schools were matched based on the state in which the schools were located, the grade-level enrollment of each school, and the free and reduced lunch data from each school. In addition to determining the impact on student achievement the impact of the four-day per week schedule on average daily attendance was examined. All schools in the study were required to use the MAP or MPG to assess student achievement. For all matched pairs the students in five-day per week schools reported higher mean RIT scores than the students in four-day per week schools, however, the only statistically significant difference identified was in second grade reading and mathematics scores. The effect size of the four-day per week school schedule varied from .23 to .68. It appeared from the data analysis that the four-day per week school schedule may negatively impact student achievement in primary grades.

Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the bonus policy increased the proportion of certified teachers in bonus-eligible schools by improving hiring, increasing certification rates of incumbent teachers, and reducing turnover. Depending on the method, we estimate that the proportion of NBCTs in treated schools increased by about four to eight percentage points over the first five years of eligibility. However, the improvement in certification rates corresponds to a change of about 0.2–0.3% of a standard deviation in teacher quality per year and we do not find evidence that the bonus resulted in detectible effects on student test achievement.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3486","BackwardCitations, Update4",,

We find reductions in both math and English/language arts achievement when examining four-day school weeks nationally, but these aggregate effects appear to be masking important heterogeneity due to differences in overall time in school across districts. When stratifying four-day week districts into districts with low, middle, and high levels of time in school, we find statistically significant negative effects on math achievement for four-day school week districts with low time in school, but no statistically significant effects for four-day school week districts with middle or high time in school. Our findings suggest that maintaining sufficient overall time in school should be a key consideration for school districts contemplating four-day school week adoption.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 49","BackwardCitations, Update4",,

Unique matched panel data from the UTD Texas Schools Project permit the identification of teacher quality based on student performance along with the impact of specific, measured components of teachers and schools. Semiparametric lower bound estimates of the variance in teacher quality based entirely on within-school heterogeneity indicate that teachers have powerful effects on reading and mathematics achievement, though little of the variation in teacher quality is explained by observable characteristics such as education or experience. The results suggest that the effects of a costly ten student reduction in class size are smaller than the benefit of moving one standard deviation up the teacher quality distribution, highlighting the importance of teacher effectiveness in the determination of school quality.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3319","BackwardCitations, Update4",,

To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its “effect” as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional DD standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an “effect” significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a “pre”- and “post”-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3331","BackwardCitations, Update4",,

We find that test scores are higher in schools that offer individual financial incentives for good performance. Moreover, the estimated relationship between the presence of merit pay in teacher compensation and student test scores is strongest in schools that may have the least parental oversight. The association between teacher incentives and student performance could be due to better schools adopting teacher incentives or to teacher incentives eliciting more effort from teachers; it is impossible to rule out the former explanation with our cross sectional data.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3352","BackwardCitations, Update4",,

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

While intended to maximize student learning, there is little empirical evidence about the effectiveness of such policies. This study examines the impact of an accountability policy implemented in the Chicago Public Schools in 1996–1997. Using a panel of student-level, administrative data, I find that math and reading achievement increased sharply following the introduction of the accountability policy, in comparison to both prior achievement trends in the district and to changes experienced by other large, urban districts in the mid-west. However, for younger students, the policy did not increase performance on a state-administered, low-stakes exam. An item-level analysis suggests that the observed achievement gains were driven by increases in test-specific skills and student effort. I also find that teachers responded strategically to the incentives along a variety of dimensions—by increasing special education placements, preemptively retaining students and substituting away from low-stakes subjects like science and social studies.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3385","BackwardCitations, Update4",,

We test the predictions from the model using data on a set of highly visible and consequential decisions facing school district leaders—the choice of learning mode during the 2020–21 school year. We find that district behavior is consistent with a Bayesian learning process in several key respects. Districts respond on the margin to health risks: All else equal, a marginal increase in new cases reduces the probability that a district offers in-person instruction the next week. This negative response is magnified when the district was in-person the prior week and attenuates in magnitude over the school year, suggesting that districts learn from experience about the effect of in-person learning on disease transmission in schools.

We find that the reform increased the exit rate of low-rated tenured teachers by 50 percent. At the same time, the teachers who replaced the exited teachers were significantly higher-performing. Ultimately, the accountability function of the reformed teacher evaluation policy resulted in higher teaching quality. However, the policy impact was limited because very few teachers received low ratings under the reformed system.

Is Technical Education Worth the Investment?","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Career and technical education (CTE) has existed in the United States for over a century, and only in recent years have there been opportunities to assess the causal impact of participating in these programs while in high school. To date, no work has assessed whether the relative costs of these programs meet or exceed the benefits as described in recent evaluations. In this paper, we use available cost data to compare average costs per pupil in standalone high school CTE programs in Connecticut and Massachusetts to the most likely counterfactual schools. Under a variety of conservative assumptions about the monetary value of known educational and social benefits, we find that programs in Massachusetts offer clear positive returns on investment, whereas programs in Connecticut offer smaller, though mostly non-negative expected returns. We also consider the potential cost effectiveness of CTE programs offered in other contexts to address questions of generalizability.</jats:p>","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3851","Handsearch, Update4",,

Student-level data from Michigan through fall 2021 yields three relevant findings. First, relative to pre-pandemic trends, fall 2021 enrollment had partially recovered for low-income, Black, and Hispanic students, but had declined further for non-low-income, White, and Asian students. Second, annual public school exit rates remained elevated for elementary students and accelerated further for middle school students. Third, public school exit is sticky and varies by chosen alternative. Only 21 percent of those who left for private schools in fall 2020 had returned by fall 2021, while 50 percent of those who left for homeschooling had returned. These findings suggest that pandemic-driven public school enrollment declines may persist, and more so among higher income families.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4160","Handsearch, Update4",,

Sixty-nine studies have estimated the effect, but results vary from large negative to positive estimates. We show that the results are systematically driven by context, publication bias, and treatment of endogeneity. Studies neglecting endogeneity suffer from an upward bias, which is almost fully compensated by publication selection in favor of negative estimates. Overall the literature suggests a negative but economically inconsequential mean effect. The effect is more substantive for decisions to drop out. To derive these results we collect 861 previously reported estimates together with 32 variables reflecting estimation context, use recently developed techniques to correct for publication bias, and employ Bayesian model averaging to assign a pattern to the heterogeneity in the literature.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4163","Handsearch, Update4",,

This increased non-participation in testing was driven primarily by formal parental withdrawal, and poorly performing students were much more likely to be withdrawn from testing. This phenomenon is consistent with schools attempting to ‘game’ the system to improve published test scores. We also provide weaker evidence that withdrawal responded more strongly to initial poor performance in independent private schools than in government schools.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4165","Handsearch, Update4",,

However, the health impact of these programs is less understood. Using a quasi-experiment of the first universal child care reform in China from 2010, this paper aims to identify whether the preschool reform produces any short-term effects on health-related outcomes of preschoolers (3-6 years old). Specifically, this reform expands access to affordable preschools that provide full-day center-based education, with school meals and essential health services on campus. I exploit the variation in the number of newly established preschools across provinces and implement difference-in-differences and triple-difference strategies. Results confirm the effectiveness of this reform by showing a strong and positive impact on preschool attendance. This paper then documents the benefits to alleviating underweight among preschoolers. Estimates show a larger effect in rural areas, suggesting that the reform narrows rural-urban disparities in education access and undernutrition prevention. I also explore the impact on caregivers’ health consciousness and find improved health-seeking behavior when children get sick.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4172","Handsearch, Update4",,

We estimate significant negative effects of the schedule on spring reading achievement (-0.07 SD) and fall-to-spring gains in math (-0.05 SD) and reading (-0.06 SD). The negative effects of the schedule are disproportionately driven by adoptions in non-rural schools and are larger for female students.

We use de-identified student-level data on each Promise recipient's actual cost of attendance, grants, and scholarships, as well as demographic and academic characteristics from school district administrative files to examine whether and how components of students’ financial aid packages and total costs of attendance changed after the Promise award increase. To account for overall trends in pricing and financial aid, we compare Promise recipients to the average first-time, full-time freshman entering the same institutions in the same year as reported by the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). With these two data sources, we assess differences in costs and awards between Promise students and their peers, on average, and examine whether and in what ways these differences changed after the increase in Promise funding. We refer to this strategy as a “quasi-difference-in-differences” design. We do not find evidence that institutions are responding to the Promise increase through aid reductions.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4181","Handsearch, Update4",,

The gaps in gender-specific teaching effectiveness are especially pronounced in mathematics. Indeed, eliminating within-teacher differences in math test score VA would reduce the gender gap in math performance by 67%. We explore what could be behind these gaps in gender-specific TVA and find no significant differences in what makes teachers effective for male and female students. We do find, however, significant associations between teacher characteristics—e.g., gender and performance in the college admission exam—and practices—e.g., paying attention to low-performing students, congratulating students who improve, and having a good relationship with students—with teacher effectiveness. Finally, we also show that math teachers tend to be biased in favor of male students and that teachers with smaller gender biases are more effective for both, male and female students.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4182","Handsearch, Update4",,

In Norway, after-school programs are an integrated part of school, used to extend the school day to a full working day. Participation is voluntary and is subject to fees paid by parents. In 2016/17, the municipality of Oslo gradually introduced and expanded an offer of free part-time participation in its after-school program, starting with city districts with a high share of children with an immigrant background who were underrepresented in the program at the time. We utilize the staggered rollout of this policy to investigate the effects on enrollment and learning outcomes and conduct an exploratory analysis of student welfare and maternal labor supply. We find that the take-up was substantial, raising enrollment rates from about 70 to 95% in the first wave of affected schools. Despite this, our difference-in-differences estimates show no overall effect of the program on academic performance, neither on average nor across subgroups. There is also little evidence that the program enhanced student well-being or decreased bullying. Heterogeneity analysis does, however, suggest that the program increased earnings for mothers with an immigrant background by about 10 percent.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4184","Handsearch, Update4",,

It uses data from Tunisia, a country in which unemployment rates for post-secondary graduates are higher than for non-graduates, particularly for women—although there is significant variation across types of diplomas and fields of study. Our main finding is that admission to an elite high school raises students’ probability to eventually get assigned to a university program associated with a lower post-graduation unemployment rate. This is particularly true for women. Focusing then on students who would have applied to post-secondary programs regardless of admission to an elite high school, we show that this effect is the result of an increase in the competitiveness of their applications rather than of a change in their probability to apply to programs lower post-graduation unemployment rate.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4196","Handsearch, Update4",,

Our study controls for selection on unobservables using a control function approach that leverages the fact that many children spend zero hours per week on enrichment activities. At zero enrichment, confounders vary but enrichment does not, giving us direct information about the effect of confounders on skills. Using time diary data available in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we find that the net effect of the last hour of enrichment is close to zero for cognitive skills and negative for non-cognitive skills. The negative effects for non-cognitive skills are concentrated in high school, consistent with elevated academic pressure related to college admissions.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4197","Handsearch, Update4",,

The estimates adjust for rich sets of controls and include measurements of children's baseline abilities. For a subset of the outcomes, we exploit within-household variation. Working memory and long-term memory are consistently and positively associated with subsequent domain-specific cognitive achievement tests (measuring specifically numeracy, vocabulary and literacy achievement) in both countries, university enrolment in Peru (long-term memory) and lower secondary-school completion in Ethiopia (working memory). Inhibitory control predicts subsequent math-test scores in both countries, grade attainment (Ethiopia), and university enrolment (Peru). Value-added estimates show that these skills play roles during adolescence, with the memory-related skills predicting higher domain-specific test scores (Peru and Ethiopia) and grade attainment (Ethiopia), while inhibitory control has associations with math (both countries).

Test engagement is also important, as it correlates with several personality traits important to life outcomes. Therefore, considering the importance of both test engagement, which influences low-stakes assessments, and proficiency, which is more accurately discerned in high-stakes assessments, policymakers should make deliberate decisions regarding the stakes assigned to assessment tests, taking into account the specific evaluation criteria that they aim to emphasize.","duplicate of 3731","Handsearch, Update4",,

TEACHNJ disproportionately increased male and Black teacher turnover, as the policy was tied to subjective evaluation criteria. TEACHNJ did not impact the quality of the teacher labor market as measured by value-added, though higher rated teachers often filled new vacancies. This matches principal–agent models where schools only use ratings to guide personnel decisions. Overall, tenure generates small declines in math value-added, while reforms tied to subjective evaluations disproportionately increase male and Black teacher turnover.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4216","Handsearch, Update4",,

The primary drivers of this advancement – infrastructure, teaching and learning evaluations, faculty dedication, and the proportion of faculty with a Ph.D. degree – are largely under the administrators’ direct control.

In this study, we examine the effects of a quota-type affirmative action policy on gaps in college outcomes between potential beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. Using comprehensive administrative data from a leading Brazilian university which implemented affirmative action in 2005, we find that compared to their non-quota peers, potential quota beneficiaries are less likely to progress smoothly through college and less likely to graduate, a result that is mostly driven by those who would not be admitted to the university otherwise. Notably, however, most of these differences shrink as the students progress through college, suggesting a catch-up effect between those groups.

We find that students perform substantially better on online exams, but that the premium largely disappears if never-before-seen questions are used. The online premium for low-performing students is particularly large, exceeding a full letter-grade, which is likely to have considerable implications for course pass rates.

We test whether charter entry reduces the supply of university teacher education degrees, exploiting within- and between-district variation in the timing of charter school entry in districts containing college teacher preparation programs. Applying a generalized difference-in-difference model, we find that a 10 percent increase in charter market share decreases the supply of traditionally prepared teachers by one percent per year on average.

The quota increased the proportion of women in the treated concentration group by nine percentage points and the share of women from low socio-economic status by three percentage points. The expansion was associated with a 0.04-unit decline in the average score ratio of female-to-male applicants, driven by a reduction in the score threshold needed for women’s admission. The effects were condensed in competitive concentrations, where the overall share of women and women with low SES increased by 17 and four percentage points, respectively.

Despite the potential for adult education programs to bridge this gap, such programs are often plagued by low enrollment, high dropout and limited skills acquisition. While there is a relative paucity of economic research on adult learning as compared with primary and secondary schooling interventions, recent research in educational neuroscience and economics offers some insights into addressing the barriers to adult learning. We review these insights and offer some concrete recommendations for adult education programs in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4241","Handsearch, Update4",,

We find that average- and high-ability female students request universities that are worse-ranked than their male peers. A survey eliciting students’ preferences suggests that male students prioritize the academic characteristics of exchange universities, whereas similar female students consider both the academic and non-academic characteristics of exchange destinations. We explore the consequences of these differing preferences using a simulation that assigns students to exchange seats solely on university ranking and students’ academic performance.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4243","Handsearch, Update4",,

Evidence from an instructional time reform","Early-life environments can have long-lasting effects on individuals’ later life courses. Interestingly, research on the effects of school reforms has hardly adopted this perspective. Therefore, we investigate a staggered school reform that reduced the number of school years and increased weekly instructional time for secondary school students in most German federal states. We analyze this quasi-experiment in a difference-in-differences framework using nationally representative large-scale survey data on 69,513 students who attended university between 1998 and 2016. Using both TWFE and weighted-group ATT estimators, we find negative effects of reform exposure on hours spent attending classes and on self-study. Moreover, reform exposure increased the time gap between school completion and higher education entry. Our results support the view that research should examine unintended long-term effects of school reforms on individual life courses.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4246","Handsearch, Update4",,

We implement a teaching methodology to improve children's mathematical skills and evaluate the causal effect of the intervention on the gender gap in mathematics in Italy with a randomised controlled trial. The methodology, grounded in active and cooperative learning, focuses on peer interaction, sharing of ideas, learning from mistakes, and problem-solving. The treatment significantly improves girls’ math performance (0.14 standard deviations), with no impact on boys, and reduces the math gender gap by about 40 %. The effect is stronger for girls with high pre-test scores.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4250","Handsearch, Update4",,

We find that Erasmus mobility improves graduation results for undergraduate students enrolled in scientific and technical fields and for those who apply in the first year of their studies, especially when enrolled in more demanding degree courses. Investigating plausible mechanisms, we find that the positive impact on performance at graduation is stronger for students who visit foreign universities of relatively lower quality compared to their home university. Finally, we do not find statistically significant effects of Erasmus mobility on postgraduate educational choices and labour market outcomes one year after graduation.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4251","Handsearch, Update4",,
5337,"Bonilla-Mejía, Leonardo, Londoño-Ortega, Erika, Henao, María Fernanda","Geographic isolation and learning: Evidence from rural schools in Colombia","Rural schools are usually behind in terms of learning, and this could be partly related to geographical isolation. We explore this hypothesis, assessing the causal effect of the distance between schools, towns, and State capitals on elementary school test scores. We use granular administrative records from Colombia and estimate spatial regression discontinuity models. Results indicate that the distance to both towns and State capitals negatively affect students test scores. The differences in educational inputs, such as teachers education attainment and contract stability, partly explain these gaps. A program providing monetary incentives to teachers in difficult access areas fails to attenuate the isolation effect.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4253","Handsearch, Update4",,

Our main contributions are a) the provision of strong experimental evidence that the intervention can improve student math learning in developing countries for closing education gaps; and b) the measurement of student anxiety levels before and after the treatment, which allows verifying whether student-tutor interactions mitigated some of the negative socioemotional effects of student confinement. The program is found to have had a positive and significant effect of 0.24 standard deviations on math learning, which is equivalent to a 33.8 percent acceleration as compared to the control group. However, no significant effects were observed on student anxiety levels, which suggests that the academic gains were not mediated by these types of socioemotional factors. The results provide valuable information for the design of tutor training and for the development of tutoring protocols, among other aspects, for future similar programs.","[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4255","Handsearch, Update4",,

METHODS: This 2-year, prepost study compared student overall average and final examination scores and overall course grades after the transition from a 5-day to a 4-day week of an integrated learning experience (ILE) course sequence. In addition, an anonymous, optional 23-item survey was distributed to first to third year pharmacy students asking about the 4-day week change, how they utilized the non-ILE day, and additional demographic and social characteristics to identify factors influencing success on examination and course performance during the 4-day week.  RESULTS: There were 533 students included in the overall analysis, with no significant differences in overall course grades in the 5-day vs 4-day week. Examination scores were not significantly different after the transition, except in 2 of 12 courses where scores were higher and final examination scores were not significantly different, except for higher final examination scores in 1 course during the 5-day week. Significant positive influencers of top quartile of examination performance included prepharmacy grade point average ≥ 3.5, age 25 to 29 years, and prepharmacy coursework at the parent institution, whereas using the non-ILE day primarily to sleep negatively influenced outcomes.  CONCLUSION: Curricular density is a prevalent problem and addressing it at a program level is essential. Reducing curricular content and hours at our institution did not adversely impact student examination and course performance and slight improvement was noted in some areas.","duplicate of 4583",,"Scoping Review Screening, Title & Abstract Screening",

However, the CB1Rs antagonist (SR141716A, SR) reversed METH-induced anxiety behaviors. The results obtained in the passive avoidance experiment showed that blockade of brain CB1Rs by SR improves METH-induced amnesia. In summary, CB1Rs appear to modulate METH-associated memories, and antagonists of CB1Rs may serve as a therapeutic target for METH-induced anxiety behaviors.",Duplicate,"Monthly, PubMed",,
