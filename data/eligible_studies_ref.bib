  abstract = {With restrictions being made on state budgets, ``the four-day school week has been an increasingly attractive option for legislators seeking to cut education costs'' (NCSL, 2014). Research has shown the beneficial and adverse aspects of an alternative school calendar through monetary interest, attendance of students and staff, morale, and academic scores (Donis-Keller \& Silvernail 2009). However, there is limited information regarding the influence shortened school weeks have on students' social choices, particularly the choices they make with activities on weekends. As a result of lengthened weekends, the purpose of this case study was to examine the perception four-day school weeks has left on the various stakeholders of a rural Montana high school, with an emphasis on extended weekends, and to investigate the specific activities high school students participate in during three-day weekends. In order to investigate this topic further, the following research questions were directed to stakeholders from a rural Montana school district that recently shifted to a four-day schedule: 1.) As a result of a four-day school week, how do rural school stakeholders view the choices made by students on extended weekends?; 2.)What choices do students make on their extended weekends, and, according to stakeholders, what influences those choices?; 3.) In what ways is the four-day school week contributing to or detracting from student well-being? Data collection was achieved through individual interviews of administrators, teachers, and coaches, a focus group was held with parents of high school students, and insight from senior students was collected through a text-messaging system called Remind. Remind provided an innovative data collection technique that maintained anonymity of adolescent participants. The findings of this case study emphasize the importance and advancement in adolescent involvement with extracurricular activities, workforce, time spent with family and peers, and religious practices. However, the findings also bring forth further questions about adolescents not involved in athletics, clubs, religious endeavors, and the workforce.},

More schools are implementing four-day school weeks to reduce overhead and transportation costs. The four-day week requires substantial schedule changes as schools must increase the length of their school day to meet minimum instructional hour requirements. Although some schools have indicated this policy eases financial pressures, it is unknown whether there is an impact on student outcomes. We use school-level data from Colorado to investigate the relationship between the four-day week and academic performance among elementary school students. Our results generally indicate a positive relationship between the four-day week and performance in reading and mathematics. These findings suggest there is little evidence that moving to a four-day week compromises student academic achievement. This research has policy relevance to the current U.S. education system, where many school districts must cut costs.},

Despite this rapid growth, scant empirical evidence has documented the factors associated with district adoption and subsequent effects on student, labor, and economic outcomes. We examine the spread of the 4-day school week in rural Missouri, where over 10\% of the state?s districts have adopted the policy in the past decade, the majority over the past 2 years. To help policymakers understand why districts forgo a day of instruction and to contextualize postpolicy effects, we conduct a survival analysis to assess student, district, and staff characteristics associated with policy adoption. We find that the presence of nearby 4-day school week districts most strongly predicts policy adoption. Adopting districts typically offer lower teacher salaries than nearby districts and have declining student enrollments. Our findings may inform policy focused on teacher recruitment and retention in rural locales.},

  abstract = {Understanding social influences is vitally important to understanding human behavior; unfortunately, observing and measuring these effects is extremely difficult. This dissertation focuses on applying and developing techniques to measure social influences on individual decision making. The first chapter develops two techniques for estimating social influences using friendship networks, even when individuals differ on unobservable attributes. The second chapter uses social networks sampled from villages in India to demonstrate strong peer influences on an individual's decision to take a microfinance loan. The final chapter examines changes in juvenile criminal behavior in response to their schools changing to a four-day school week. An abstract for each chapter is provided below.   Chapter 1 Abstract: Existing methods for identifying peer effects in social networks require the assumption that there are no unobserved factors that determine both network links and the outcome of interest. Since this assumption is likely to be violated in most networks, I provide two distinct methods for estimating peer effects in the presence of individual heterogeneity. First, I show that if repeated observations on individuals are available, accounting for time-invariant individual attributes can restore identification. Second, I suggest a semi-parametric Bayesian instrumental variables technique that can be used to estimate peer effects models when panel data is not available or if fixed effects assumptions are undesirable. I demonstrate the properties of both strategies using simulated network data and provide evidence that both are able to estimate peer effects, even when networks exhibit sorting on observable and unobservable attributes. Additionally, I apply both techniques to estimate peer effects in the United States Congress using cosponsorship networks and voting outcomes.   Chapter 2 Abstract: I use friendship networks from villages in rural India to provide a careful examination of peer effects in decisions to take up microfinance. Using social networks resolves the traditional identification problems associated with peer effect estimation and allows each individual to have their own peer group. Since the networks in question are sampled and some friendship information is missing, I use an analytic correction to ensure unbiased estimates as well as a technique known as graphical reconstruction to provide bounds on estimators accounting for possible configurations of the unobserved links in the data. In addition to including a variety of individual covariates, I control for observable characteristics of an individual's peers, examine different ways of specifying network links, and account for the probability of being informed about the program. Across these specifications I find positive and significant peer effects; an additional friend participating in microfinance increases the probability that an individual participates in microfinance by 6\%-10\%.   Chapter 3 Abstract: There has been a recent trend to implement four-day school weeks, especially in rural areas. We show that changing to a four-day school week influences youth criminal activity in jurisdictions where these policies take effect, especially impacting property crime. Focusing on Colorado, where four-day school weeks are especially prevalent, we show that switching all students in a county to a four-day week leads to 0.75 additional juvenile arrests for larceny per 1,000 residents. Effects on other types of crime are inconclusive; estimated signs on drug and violent crimes are negative, although neither attains statistical significance.},

  abstract = {Ever since the 1983 landmark study, A Nation at Risk, was released, educators have been examining the effectiveness of instructional time in American schools (Pedersen, 2012). However, school calendars have remained stagnant and seemingly a product of society and economy, tied to agriculture, for over 100 years (Turner \& Finch, 2018). In Missouri, a growing number of schools are reevaluating the five-day school week and implementing a four-day school week in response (Turner \& Finch, 2018). As stated by Thompson (2020), the impact of the four-day school week on student achievement requires more study. This study involved investigating the impact of the four-day school week on student academic achievement by examining 7th-grade and 8th-grade MAP data provided by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in the areas of math and ELA prior to and following the implementation of the four-day school week. Additionally, the perceptions of principals and teachers who work within the four-day school were collected to examine teacher morale, school finance, student discipline, and overall attendance (teachers and students). Quantitative data were analyzed to investigate pre- and post-implementation patterns. Furthermore, qualitative data in the form of interview responses were analyzed using coding methods to identify common phrases, keywords, and themes. The study findings revealed the four-day school week produced a negative impact on 7th-grade ELA, according to MAP data analysis, whereas 7th-grade math, 8th-grade ELA, and 8th-grade math indicated an insignificant impact. Additionally, the perceptions of principals and teachers indicated the four-day school week was an overall benefit to the school climate.},

  abstract = {This dissertation uses reduced-form techniques to causally answer questions of direct importance in the fields of public policy broadly, but more specifically in the areas of health economics, labor economics, and education. The first chapter examines the effectiveness of Ohio's "Vax-a-Million" vaccination campaign -- a state-funded program that offered entry to a cash lottery for getting (or having already received) the vaccine for the COVID-19 coronavirus. We used an improvement upon the synthetic control method, which allowed us to generate a ``Synthetic Ohio'' which we could use as an untreated counterfactual. Using public health data, we find that the lottery was effective not only in boosting vaccination rates, but in also reducing COVID cases and ICU utilization. Finally, using an estimate of the high costs of ICU occupancy, we perform a back of the envelope cost-benefit analysis and find that the lottery had a benefit cost ratio of at least 10:1, saving the state of Ohio over 60 million dollars. The second and third chapters explore teacher labor supply responses to the recent, rapid adoption of a radical change in the traditional school schedule -- going from five days a week to four -- in K-12 education observed throughout the country. While this policy has been adopted by 26 U.S. states, I focus my efforts on Oklahoma -- a state that has seen more than 20 percent of its districts make the scheduling change since 2010 -- and use publicly-available employment records from the Oklahoma State Department of Education to examine the effect that this schedule change had on teacher retention and quality. In the second chapter, I investigate the impact that this schedule change had on schools' ability to recruit quality teachers and to retain current (and new) faculty. Since the policy had a staggered rollout, I use an event study design to align schools in event time. I find that adoption of the policy is associated with higher retention of new teachers with zero prior experience, increased recruitment of teachers with prior experience, and a reduction in the need for emergency certifications for teachers, which serves as a proxy for improved teaching quality. In the third chapter, I describe the labor market for Oklahoma public schoolteachers and analyze the career trajectory of teachers who are early in their careers and new at their school, some of whom are exposed to, or have selected into, the four-day schedule change. I model their tenure using a duration (or hazard/survival) model and find confirmatory evidence that the four-day week substantially improves retention.},

  abstract = {A number of school districts throughout the nation have changed their delivery method of a five-day school week to a four-day school week. Between 2009 and 2015, 27 Idaho school districts transitioned to a four-day school week, bringing the total number of school districts on a four-day week to 44 by 2015. This number increased to 45 by 2018. As school districts have become more comfortable with the four-day week schedule, school employees and constituents alike have increased satisfaction. A four-day school week results in about 20\% fewer days of student and teacher contact days. This leads to a concern of how a four-day school week impacts academic performance. The purpose of this quantitative research study was to look at student achievement scores, specifically in Idaho rural public schools. The research compared standardized test scores of rural school districts on the four-day school week to the same test scores of rural school districts on the five-day school week. Additionally, sub populations with similar demographics were analyzed. These demographics included economically disadvantaged (free and reduced lunch percentages) and the percentage of Hispanics/Latinos. School districts that had an economically disadvantaged population of at least 45\% were also analyzed. Five years of historical standardized test scores were gathered from the Idaho Department of Education beginning with the 2014-2015 school year and ending with the 2018-2019 school year. The standardized test scores that were analyzed included the Idaho Reading Indicator (IRI) and the Idaho Standards Achievement Test (ISAT). While results indicate that school districts on a five-day school week consistently had a higher percentage of proficient/advanced students on standardized tests when compared to four-day week school districts, there was no statistically significant impact (p{$\geq$}.05) on the academic performance, as determined by the previously mentioned standardized metrics. Only one year (instead of five years) of the Hispanic/Latino sub population was able to be compared because of the significant redactions that took place in order to be compliant with privacy laws.},

The 4-year intervention consisted of full day, monthly staff development sessions for both teachers and administrator. Content was drawn from effective schools research and conventional wisdom about educational practice and was intended to improve student achievement by providing inservice to their teachers. Peer observations and teacher support groups facilitated the change process. A research component was in place throughout the project to monitor"time-on-task/engagement rates" and student achievement. Baseline data indicated quite high engagement rates during the life of the project. Achievement scores did not reflect this same degree of increase. This final report presents: (1) a complete description of the project context; (2) content and process of the training provided; (3) effects of the inservice on teachers' behaviors and attitudes; and (4) changes in student engagement rate and achievement.

Thirteen districts implemented the four-day program in the 1980-81 school year. Ten additional districts applied as first year pilot programs in the 1981-82 school year. A study conducted by Colorado State University of the original 13 school districts found that all districts demonstrated the potential of the schedule to save energy and transportation costs, and to reduce student and teacher absenteeism. In addition, student achievement levels were comparable to their achievement prior to experiencing the four-day week. Parents, teachers, and students favored the four-day concept over a five-day week by a wide margin. The school districts found they achieved notable cost savings in many areas and there were important strategic considerations surrounding the decision of taking Monday or Friday off. In addition to information from the study, other observation and study have led to conclusions that: negative factors must also be carefully examined (some students will have excess time around town, the school day is very long for young children, etc.), and a community and school should avoid moving into a four-day schedule without careful study and planning.

For influenza in schools, the Center of Disease Control  (CDC) recommends that febrile students remain isolated at home until they have  been fever-free for at least one day and a related policy is recommended for  SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19). Other authors proposed using a school week of four or fewer  days of in-person instruction for all students to reduce transmission. However,  there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of these interventions.  METHODS: We introduced a mathematical model of school outbreaks that considers  both intervention methods. Our model accounts for the school structure and  schedule, as well as the time-progression of fever symptoms and viral shedding.  The model was validated on outbreaks of seasonal and pandemic influenza and  COVID-19 in schools. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the  proportion of the population infected (attack rate) under the proposed  interventions. RESULTS: For influenza, the CDC-recommended one day of post-fever  isolation can reduce the attack rate by a median (interquartile range) of 29 (13  - 59)\%. With two days of post-fever isolation the attack rate could be reduced by  70 (55 - 85)\%. Alternatively, shortening the school week to four and three days  reduces the attack rate by 73 (64 - 88)\% and 93 (91 - 97)\%, respectively. For  COVID-19, application of post-fever isolation policy was found to be less  effective and reduced the attack rate by 10 (5 - 17)\% for a two-day isolation  policy and by 14 (5 - 26)\% for 14 days. A four-day school week would reduce the  median attack rate in a COVID-19 outbreak by 57 (52 - 64)\%, while a three-day  school week would reduce it by 81 (79 - 83)\%. In both infections, shortening the  school week significantly reduced the duration of outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS:  Shortening the school week could be an important tool for controlling influenza  and COVID-19 in schools and similar settings. Additionally, the CDC-recommended  post-fever isolation policy for influenza could be enhanced by requiring two days  of isolation instead of one.},

The population in the study included 521 public school districts.  This study has been broken into two distinct data analysis phases using hierarchical linear modeling to measure the relationship between the study predictive variables and teacher retention.  The first analysis was conducted using time-varying variables at the district-level.  The second phase of the analysis was conducted using time-invariant variables.  Data were collected over a five-year time period, 2013-2017.  This study found statistically significant relationships between higher teacher salaries, instructional and support resources, and proximity of the district to teacher retention.  In addition, the study indicated a four-day workweek, administrative expenditures, and percent of economically disadvantaged students were significantly and inversely related to teacher retention.},

Chapter 1 provides background information on the study population, economic and educational conditions in Vermont, and PSA standards and review processes. In chapter 2, a literature review considers the diverse, special characteristics of small, rural schools. Chapter 3 describes inputs, process indicators, outcome indicators, and qualitative characteristics of the 10 K-12 schools studied and summarizes the impact of PSA on their finances and curricula. This section also discusses how two comparable schools coped somewhat differently with school improvement mandates and limited funding. The results indicate that rural schools are facing the challenge of small size and fiscal constraints with distance learning, independent study, cross-disciplinary teaching, and multi-age groupings. Chapter 4 considers various strategies for improving educational quality at an affordable cost, including funding strategies, financial management, school-community cooperation, distance learning technologies, the 4-day school week, and integrated services. The last chapter concludes that the PSA has had a substantial impact on K-12 schools in terms of personnel appointments, curricular revisions, and facility improvements, but that these gains may be short-lived if the contingent fiscal problems are not solved. Appendices include K-12 schools statistical data, school site statistical profiles, and school site visitation summaries. Contains 101 references. (LP)},

The product will provide school districts with a resource to address their needs, questions, and concerns around all aspects of the transition to a four-day school week, including policy, community relations, human resources, scheduling, finances, and student achievement.     Over the past five years, weakening economic conditions have wreaked havoc across the country in most industries. Missouri public school districts have not been spared the hardship, as decreases in property tax subsidies and state budget shortfalls create lasting deficiencies in funding. With the passage of four-day school week/alternative calendar legislation, this economic crisis has spurred school districts in Missouri and across the nation to investigate options for an alternative calendar or four-day school week in order to reduce spending.     The need for an operations manual surfaced as the team examined four-day school week research and during the interviews of state department leaders from many states expressing limited guidance existed for districts investigating or making the transition to a four-day school week. District leaders considering this change have been forced to conduct their own research and develop an implementation plan without any guidance. As more and more districts consider this option, it will be beneficial for them to have a guide with the resources needed to implement the four-day school week. The purpose of this study was to identify what school leaders and policymakers need to know when considering or implementing a four-day school week.     An expert panel, consisting of school leaders and state education officials knowledgeable in educational policy and in the research and practice of school district administration reviewed the operations manual as part of the pilot. Following the expert panel review, the manual was refined based on recommendations and submitted to another expert panel for field test feedback. A complete evaluation of the final field-test recommendations and revisions were incorporated into the manual.},

Data were obtained by sending a survey instrument to superintendents of 15 randomly selected Colorado school districts that had converted to a 4-day school week schedule. A portion of the survey instrument obtained data pertaining to the rank ordering of each day of the week in the following categories: co-curricular youth sport activities, other youth co-curricular activities (excluding sports), and community activities. The superintendents were asked their opinions on nine items that reflected aspects of the community educational philosophy. Major findings of the study were: (1) school districts had not markedly altered the scheduling of their co-curricular and community activities; (2) when pairing the superintendents' mean score on the opinionnaire with the amount of building use in that school district on their day off, it showed that superintendents that have a more community oriented philosophy may encourage more use of the school facility; and (3) there was no difference in the amount of building use when comparing school districts with Mondays off with school districts with Fridays off.

  abstract = {Many published influenza models treat each simulation day as a weekday and do not distinguish weekend days. Consequently, the weekend effect on influenza transmission has not been fully explored. To assess whether distinguishing between weekday and weekend transmissions in simulation models of flu-like infectious disease models matters, this study uses an agent-based model of the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. Our study assesses whether including weekend effects is offset by increases in weekend contact patterns and if implementing 3-day weekends dampens disease transmission enough to warrant its use as a containment strategy. Results indicate that ignoring weekend behaviors without incorporating increases in community-based non-school contacts (i.e., compensatory behaviors) causes the peak case incidence day to occur 7 days earlier and can reduce the peak attack rate by as much as 60 \%. These results are sensitive to the proportion of symptomatic cases that are assumed to remain at home until they recover. The 3-day weekend intervention has interesting possibilities, but the benefits may only be effective for mild epidemics. However, a 3-day weekend for schools would be less detrimental to the educational process than sustained permanent closing because student and teacher contact is maintained throughout the epidemic period. Also, a 4-day school and work week may be more easily accommodated by many types of schools and businesses. On the other hand, an additional day per week of school closure could result in substantial societal costs, with lost productivity and child care costs outweighing the savings of preventing influenza cases.},

The research question studied was what is the relationship between the four\textendash day school week and teacher retention in rural school districts? Within the quantitative research design, the causal\textendash comparative design was the selected procedure. The sample in this study was public educators teaching in rural public-school districts with a four-day school week as compared to teachers with a five-day school week from the state of Idaho. This data was collected in the Fall of 2021 into the Spring of 2022 from databases in the West and Midwest regions of the United States. Next, descriptive statistics were employed, including independent sample t-tests to investigate the discrepancies in teacher retention rates among rural public schools with four-day school weeks and those five-day school weeks by a variety of variables. The research compared teacher retention in rural school districts on the four-day school week to the rate of teacher retention in rural school districts on the five-day school week. Three years of historical teacher retention data was collected from the Idaho Department of Education beginning with the 2017-2018 school year and ending with the 2019-2020 school year. While results indicate that school districts on a five-day school week consistently had a higher rate of teacher retention when compared to districts on a four-day school week, there was no statistically significant impact (p{$>\_$}.05).},

The final step in the study was to determine teachers' perceptions of school climate by administering the Organizational Climate Index, which was created by Hoy, Smith, and Sweetland (2002). The school climate portion of the study consisted of teacher participants from the 10 participating schools. This survey was administered to 70 teacher participants using Survey Monkey (Survey Monkey, 2018); 35 teachers were employed at a four-day secondary school, and 35 were employed at a five-day secondary school. The responses were scored and an average score was found for the both the four-day teacher responses and the five-day teacher responses. The scores were compared in an independent t-Test.

A first analysis identified two groups of students: one (N=62) provided a sequence starting with grade three and going through grade six, and a second (N=45) started with grade four and went through grade seven. A second analysis examined the performance of a given grade level for each of the four consecutive years for grades three, four, five, and six. Analysis of the ITBS scales revealed that the change to a four-day school week had no effect on student  academic achievement, although there was a suggestion that there might be some leveling of performance during the first year the schools were on the four-day schedule. Analysis of the same grade level across the four-year period also provided no clear evidence that the change had any effect on student achievement. The significant differences might be explained by the observation that one year or class of students performs quite differently from another. (BRR)},

  abstract = {Colorado law requires school districts to schedule 1080 hours per year of instructional time for secondary schools and 990 instructional hours for elementary schools. The 1080 hours equate to six hours per day for 180 days. The 990 hours equate to five and one-half hours per day. Up to 24 hours may be counted for parent-teacher conferences, staff in-service programs, and closing for reasons of health, safety, or welfare of students. The law also requires any district offering less than 160 days of school to obtain permission from the Commissioner of Education. Sixty-two school districts, constituting 34\% of the 178 school districts in Colorado, serving 2.7\% of students, utilize the four-day week as the structure for organizing their school year. Those districts schedule 7.5 hours per day for 144 days of school instead of the normal six hours for 180 days. In some cases, only a few of the district schools are on a four-day week. For example, in Moffat County RE-1, only Maybell Elementary is on a four-day week. In Mesa County Valley 51, only New Emerson School is on a four-day week. This paper presents observations based on extensive conversations with practitioners in four-day districts and visitations to most of those districts. The impact of the shift to the four-day week as it relates to finance, child care, instruction, politics, and student performance are discussed.},

  abstract = {New ways of managing schools that save money while providing the same quality of education is always a goal. The saving of money is always needed to assure that we make the most of our tax dollars without spending more than is required. The purpose of this quantitative study was to identify the relationship between student test scores from a five-day school week and student test scores from a four-day school week. This study also sought to identify the relationship between student attendance rates for students attending a five-day school week and attendance rates for students attending a four-day school week. Student ACT composite test scores and attendance rates were acquired using statistical information gathered by the state's department of education's website annually. Student ACT composite scores compiled prior to the move to a four day school week were compared to the ACT composite scores compiled during the years the same school followed a traditional five-day school week. School student attendance rates compiled prior to the move to a four day school week were compared to the school student attendance rates compiled during the years the same school followed a traditional five-day school week. Dependent t-tests of reliability were used along with Cohen's d strength tests to compare student ACT Composite test scores and attendance rates before and after the conversion to four-day school weeks. The results of this study show test result and student attendance downward trends that may be worthwhile studying in the future when more examples and more data become available. When the attendance rates of the schools in this study that converted to a four-day school week were averaged together, the attendance rates of the schools in this study went down .13 percent. This was not found to be a significant difference. The ACT Composite test scores of the schools in this study, when averaged together, went down an average of .49 points which was found to be an insignificant difference despite two outlier schools whose scores went down over two points on average. The conversion to a four-day school week may or may not be deemed successful due to the increase in attendance for the schools involved depending on the goal of the school and whether they believe less than half of a point in test score drops is too significant compared to the maximum increase in attendance of 7.9 percent.

This study looked at schools in the state of Colorado that have participated in the 4-day school schedule during the school years 2005\textendash 2008 and found that there were no effects of the 4-day school schedule on 3rdgrade reading, writing, and math scores compared to those scores in comparably sized schools operating on a more traditional 5-day schedule. In addition, there is no relationship between 3rd-grade Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) assessments for 3rd-grade students on a 4-day or 5-day schedule. According to the study, 3rd-grade students attending a 4-day school week scored better than or equal to the state CSAP percentage proficient and above for 2005\textendash 2008. Quantitative research methods were used, data were collected, and the analysis added research to the effects of time on achievement.},

  abstract = {For over a century, most PK-12 schools across the United States have been using the same format of five days of school a week for approximately 9 months a year.  The discussion of a four-day school week is being considered as many school districts try to balance their budgets each school year.  Some schools in the past 30 years have begun changing to a four-day school week.  The four-day school week can create controversy within a community, concerns among parents and students, and benefits for the school district as well as for parents and students.  The researcher studied one rural school district transitioning from a five-day school week to a four-day school week.  The purpose of the study was to identify what made a rural school district decide to transition to a four-day school week, how the school district accomplished this new delivery of PK-12 education, and to identify perceptions regarding this transition.     The case study was completed with one rural Minnesota school district.  The researcher conducted on-site interviews with school administration and one school board member, and gathered school district data from the past three years to review and identify how the school district changed to a four-day school week.       The results from the data collected indicated the school district transitioned to a four-day school week because of financial reasons.  The school district did not want to reduce educational opportunities for students by eliminating class offerings or cutting teaching positions.  The data indicated, after experiencing the four-day school week, most students, parents, and teachers favored the new four-day school week compared to the previous five-day school week.  The main concerns identified by the participants and data reviewed were younger students adapting to the longer school day, extracurricular adjustments, upset classified personnel, how much money would the district save, and tired employees at the end of the four-day week.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this quantitative comparative quasi-experimental study was to compare the perceptions of work-life balance and turnover intentions of four-day and five-day rural Oklahoma classroom teachers. Four-day school districts have become increasingly popular across the United States as a way to reduce operational expenses, with 92 four-day school districts in Oklahoma in 2019. However, Oklahoma's Senate Bill 441 (2019) required four-day school districts to return to a five-day schedule unless they showed cost-savings and students met or exceeded academic performance standards on state assessments. Hobfoll's (1989) Model of Conservations of Resources (COR) theory guided the study, which sought to explore the perceptions of work-interference with personal life (WIPL), personal life interference with work (PLIW), or work/personal life enhancement (WPLE), and turnover intentions of Oklahoma rural classroom teachers. A 15-item work-life balance survey adopted by Hayman (2005) and a single-item Turnover Intentions Scale developed by Spector et al. (1988) survey was administered through the online platform Qualtrics to 144 participants consisting of pre-K through 12th grade Oklahoma classroom teachers who worked in four-day and five-day rural school districts. The participants represented ten Oklahoma rural school districts of four-day and five-day schedules with 700 students or less. The study's findings found no statistically significant differences between four-day and five-day rural classroom teachers' work-life balance, particularly in work interference with personal life (WIPL), personal life interference with work (PLIW), work/personal life enhancement (WPLE), or turnover intentions. The research findings had implications for educational leaders, policymakers, and stakeholders providing the educational perspective of work-life balance and turnover intentions and its impact on teachers.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was two-fold: (a) to explore teacher perceptions about the four- versus five-day school week in terms of its impact on teacher/student attendance, and student achievement; and (b) to examine whether or not differences have been evidenced in teacher/student attendance, student achievement within a single school district that previously employed a five-day school week and changed to a four-day school week. The researcher conducted a census during the fall of 2012, distributing a demographic survey to all 23 of the high school teachers teaching in the target high school in a small rural school district in the western United States which had adopted the four-day school week in 2005. The researcher interviewed eight of the high school teachers who met the inclusion criteria regarding experience with both the four- and five-day school schedule. The focus of the study was on the qualitative data, with aggregate quantitative data regarding student and teacher attendance and ISAT scores collected from the District through the State's Department of Education website, used to explicate the qualitative findings. The overall feeling among interviewees regarding attendance of both students and teachers was that it either improved permanently, improved temporarily, or there was no change. All eight interviewees felt that at worst there had been no change, or that student achievement improved with the move to the four-day school week schedule. The researcher also included teacher perceptions regarding other areas such as schedule transition, teacher morale, use of instructional time, teacher planning and collaboration, and professional development. The interviewees felt pleased with their school's transition to a four-day school week schedule and felt that teacher morale had improved with the change. It was perceived that the four-day week allowed for more quality instructional time, with more time to plan and coordinate lesson plans. While the quantitative data trends implied student achievement fluctuation more so than strong positive achievement gains, like the qualitative findings, negative or downward trends were not evidenced. These findings contribute to the overall empirical body of knowledge regarding the four-day school week schedule.

The researcher was primarily interested in the ability of the four-day model to attract and retain teaching staff, although he was also interested in the impact on student achievement. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible effects of the four-day school week model on teacher attraction and retention in a rural school district in Missouri. The researcher conducted interviews with seven principals of schools that had adopted the model. He also deployed a survey consisting of closed- and open-ended questions to collect the opinions of respondents working at those seven schools. Additionally, he retrieved assessment data from the state's public education website. First, the researcher collected data from the human resources department about teacher retention rates and the number of applicants who applied for teaching positions in the district for a period of three year prior to becoming a four-day school week district. Second, the researcher sent out anonymous surveys to all teachers in the school district to collect information from open-ended questions about the reasons they either joined or stayed with a four-day school district. Lastly, the researcher collected data from the human resources department about teacher retention rates and the number of applicants who applied for teaching positions in the district for each school year since implementing the four-day school week. Secondary data was analyzed to determine if MAP scores were affected by the four-day school week. The researcher suggests rural, Missouri schools struggling with retaining and attracting teaching staff to implement the four-day school week in order to increase teacher retention and teacher candidates for open positions.},

A survey conducted in 1975 by the Cimarron District (survey form and results included in report) indicated community acceptance of the program. The Liberty School District, a large rural district with one small high school and two small elementary schools, excluded Friday from the school week. This provided a significant decrease in the use of heating oils, natural gas, and electricity. In order to meet Washington requirements, schools started 15 minutes earlier and ended 1 hour later. Projections indicated that the typical high school student would gain almost 31 school days over a 4-year period, despite the fact that school would start one week later and operate for 144 days instead of 180. The gain was attributed to longer class periods, the fact that teacher in-service and parent-teacher conferences were no longer held on school days, and time saved in setting up and cleaning classrooms. Liberty School District realized many advantages and few disadvantages from the program. (CM)},

  abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays in applied microeconomics that address topics of human and social capital accumulation. The first essay addresses the topic of women and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math.) Women are substantially less likely than men to graduate college with a STEM degree. This paper investigates whether class composition can help explain why women are disproportionately more likely to fall out of the STEM "pipeline''. Identification comes from a standardized enrollment process at a large public university that randomly assigns freshmen to different mandatory introductory chemistry lectures. Using administrative data, I find that women who are enrolled in a class with higher ability peers are less likely to graduate with a STEM degree, while men's persistence in STEM is unaffected by class composition. I also show that the decline for women is most pronounced for those in the bottom third of the ability distribution. I rule out the possibility that this is driven solely by grades because both men and women receive higher grades in classes with higher ability peers. Overall, these results suggest that class composition as an important factor in determining STEM persistence for women and provide a novel explanation for part of the STEM gender gap in post-secondary education.   The second essay, co-authored with Daniel Argyle, examines the effect of the four-day school week in rural Colorado on juvenile crimes. Four-day school weeks are becoming more common nationwide especially in rural areas. Those affected by the policy spend the same number of hours in school each week as students on a typical five-day week, however the four-day week schedule essentially reallocates unstructured time into larger blocks creating a three-day weekend every weekend, since treated students for the most part have Fridays off. Our difference-in-difference estimates for rural Colorado indicate that switching all students in a county from a five-day week to a four-day week increases juvenile arrests for property crimes, in particular larceny, by about 80\%.   In the third essay, co-authored with Christiana Stoddard, we study the academic achievement of American Indians. The academic achievement of American Indians has not been extensively studied. Using NAEP supplements, we find that the average achievement relative to white students resembles other disadvantaged groups. However, there are several differences. Family characteristics explain two times as much of the raw gap as for blacks. School factors also account for a larger portion of the gap than for blacks or Hispanics. The distribution is also strikingly different: low performing American Indian students have a substantially larger gap than high performing students. Finally, racial self-identification is more strongly related to achievement, especially as American Indian students age.},

This policy allows us to learn about two aspects of the school-crime relationship that have previously been unstudied: one, the effects of a frequent and permanent schedule change on short-term crime, and two, the impact that school attendance has on youth crime in rural areas. Our difference-in-difference estimates show that following policy adoption, agencies containing students on a four-day week experience about a 20\% increase in juvenile criminal offenses, where the strongest effect is observed for property crime.},

  abstract = {As four-day school weeks continue to gain popularity among school districts across the United States, determining the potential impact associated with the unconventional school week has become increasingly important (Johnson, 2013). The four-day school week has been credited with producing a number of potential benefits and consequences, but there is currently a limited amount of research available to determine the overall worth of the practice compared to the five-day school week. Some purported impacts of the four-day school week include shifts in teacher and student attendance, changes in achievement, financial adjustments, decreases in dropout rates, and improvement in morale (Plucker, Cierniak, \& Chamberlin, 2012). This study involved investigating the system-wide impact of the four-day school week by examining attendance, ACT scores, and dropout rates before and after implementation in participating school districts across Missouri. Additionally, the school climate perceptions of Missouri administrators and teachers who work within the four-day school week were collected. Interview responses were then analyzed using coding methods to identify common phrases, key words, and themes, while the quantitative data were treated to examine pre- and post-implementation patterns. The findings of this study revealed the four-day school week produced a statistically positive significant impact on attendance, whereas ACT scores and dropout rates were not influenced. Furthermore, the perceptions of administrators and teachers indicated the four-day school week was beneficial to the school culture.

Analysis revealed 3 main strategies to increase PA:  structured/non-competitive activities; structured/competitive activities; and  increasing school and community-wide capacity. CONCLUSION: The results from this  study provide a school health perspective on the 4-day school week.},

  abstract = {Students in about 100 schools in 10 states attend classes 4 days a week, for all or part of the school year. A growing number of rural schools, faced with declining enrollments and diminishing state aid, are experimenting with this schedule. Benefits of the schedule include lower energy and transportation costs and lower absenteeism among students and teachers. Holding classes 7.5 hours a day, 4 days a week, provides the same amount of instructional time as the traditional schedule, but with more time-on-task and less wasted time. Students have had no real problems adjusting to the longer day. Teacher, student, and parent attitudes toward the 4-day week have been generally positive. The 10 New Mexico school districts operating on the 4-day week reported cost savings of 10-25\% on fuel, electricity, and transportation; standardized achievement test scores comparable to state norms; and a collective dropout rate of 3.3\% (versus 8.1\% statewide). In the 12 Colorado districts on the 4-day schedule, students showed some gains and some losses in academic achievement, with no clear evidence that student achievement was suffering. This report contains 11 references and the third, fifth, and eighth grade scores on the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills for 16 small New Mexico school districts (including 7 on the 4-day schedule) from 1982-83 to 1985-86.

Data from earlier five-day-week years were compared with data from the four-day-week program of each district. Public records and administrator interviews provided data on organizational adjustments needed to accommodate the program. The program's effects on people were obtained through questionnaires administered to parents, students, and teachers, and through attendance data on teachers and students. Expenditure data from the Uniform Financial and Accounting System (UFARS) was used in selection of expenditure changes which may have been attributable to the program.

Four-day school week school districts in South Dakota rose over the course of 11 years from one in 1995 to 16 in 2006; this generated interest.    Information was gathered and compared for the 16 school districts for the year preceding implementation and the 2005-2006 school years. Areas of interest included student enrollment, certified staff numbers, attendance, drop-out and graduation rates, discipline incidents, achievement, and transportation budgets.    Five school districts were selected for an in-depth study. The selection was based on the following criteria: the superintendent was present in that position at the time that the school district implemented their four-day school week schedule, the school districts were not in their first year of implementation, the school districts represented eastern and western areas of the state, the school districts represented districts with large and small student populations, and the chosen school districts represented districts with a range of areas (as measured in square miles).    The researcher conducted 60 on-site interviews of stakeholder groups including superintendents, principals, teachers, students, and parents to learn about their perceptions concerning the four-day week.    Processes followed in planning and implementing a four-day school week schedule varied among the school districts. The advantages most often mentioned by stakeholders were improvement of morale, achievement, attendance, more family time, and supplementary programs. The disadvantages most often mentioned by stakeholders were the intensity or length of the school day and child care on the non-attendance day (Friday).    Student enrollment, the number of certified staff members, and graduation rates decreased in the majority of the 16 four-day week school districts during the time of comparison. Attendance, achievement, drop-out rates, and transportation costs increased in the majority of the sixteen four-day school weeks for the same time frame.},

Initially a cost-saving measure, school leaders hoped that the move to an amended calendar would not compromise the quality of education that students receive in the system. This study examines student achievement data from eighth-graders in the pseudonymous Rockbridge County Schools to determine if there was any change in student performance after the changed calendar structure. Using reading and math scores from Georgia's standardized summative assessment, this study compares historical student achievement data on the traditional five-day school week to achievement data on the four-day school week over a six-year period. Data from students with disabilities were also compared and examined separately to determine if there was a disproportionate change in performance for this subgroup. The researcher found no significant difference in student achievement for any Rockbridge County students (including those students with disabilities), and student performance actually increased after the change to the amended calendar.

Methods: Data are from a population-based survey of high-school students. Student responses were weighted to school enrollment, and schools were classified by length of the school week. Indicators of health behaviors and outcomes were compared between the two groups, adjusted for student and school characteristics. Results: A 4-day school week was associated with several positive health outcomes (improved student engagement, decreased substance use behaviors, decreased non-school screen time, and increased physical activity) as well as several negative health outcomes (increased bullying, increased sexual activity, decreased sleep, and breakfast consumption). Conclusions: Our study found mixed health outcomes associated with attending schools with shortened weeks. The findings may be related to longer school days and a non-contact day, but further research is needed.},

The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine math teachers' experiences attending professional development during a four-day instructional week in East Texas. This alternative schedule provided for a full day of professional development for math teachers during the work week. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews with six math teachers and triangulated with interviews from three other staff members working in this setting at a middle school. Data analysis occurred through open coding and axial coding resulting in four themes. This study found that teachers felt a need to be supported by their administration, and that teachers felt that a day of professional development was overall more beneficial to them and their students in lieu of an additional day of instruction. Implications for the findings and recommendations include teachers and administrators working together to help teachers feel supported, teachers finding time to make sure professional development is a priority, and teachers attending professional development they feel will help them be more effective.},

School districts are facing difficulties in maximizing education while operating on a tight budget. The purpose of this mixed-method study is to evaluate the financial impact of going to a four-day school week and to explore the perceptions of employee morale. The significance of this study may give insight to educational leaders on alternative ways to utilize school calendars more efficiently.    The quantitative research question for this study was, What impact does the four-day week have on school districts' yearly financial expenditures? The null hypothesis was, The four-day week will have no impact on the districts' yearly financial expenditures. The alternative hypothesis was, The four-day week will have a significant impact on the districts' yearly financial expenditures with a significant decrease in the amount of money spent. To address this research question the researcher chose all school districts in the state of Missouri that operated on a four-day week schedule for 2014\textendash 2015. The ADA expenditures for the first year the selected districts went to the four-day week schedule and the last year the selected districts were on the five-day week schedules were the two dependent variables collected. The p-value from the paired t-test conducted was 0.416; therefore, the researcher would retain the (Ho).

The following question drives this research: How did a small school district install and implement a four day school week as it relates to school leadership, students, parents, and community? A subquestion that will be looked at is: Did the school look at the four day week calendar as a type of school reform or did they view it as just a calendar change? A qualitative case study design is used for this research study. Interviews and document collection drive the data collection. This study will use the stages of implementation from National Implementation Research Network (NIRN) for the conceptual framework.

  abstract = {There is limited data on competition among schools for student enrollment. Such competition could have adverse financial and programmatic impacts on traditional schools. The purpose of this study was to determine if a local district- managed traditional school could compete with a local, independent charter school by making changes to the traditional school's curriculum, schedule, and teacher delivery of the curriculum. The conceptual framework for this study was that of educational entrepreneurship. The questions guiding the research concerned understanding whether recent initiatives influenced parents' and students' selection of the traditional school over the charter school. This exploratory case study utilized data collected through student, parent, and faculty questionnaires and interviews conducted to evaluate the traditional school's initiatives to increase student enrollment. The researcher identified common themes from the questionnaires and interviews. Results, suggested that students attended the traditional school because they could earn credits quickly, the traditional school's 4 day schedule, and the individualized instruction. Implications for social change including increasing student enrollments by way of helping traditional schools to be more competitive with charter schools. This could result in more educational choices for students and parents resulting in an increased graduation rate.},

For example, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and South Dakota have more than 500 districts using a 4dsw. The transition to the 4dsw and the debate over its effects have taken place largely in the absence of empirical evidence. To address this knowledge gap, a team of researchers from the RAND Corporation conducted a large-scale study of the 4dsw using data from 36 districts across Idaho, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The study addressed two overarching research questions: (1) How is the 4dsw implemented?; and (2) What are the benefits and drawbacks of the 4dsw? This study, the largest of its kind to date, presents findings that can help inform choices by school, district, and state education leaders about the 4dsw model and develop policies or guide change as needed. Although this research can help promote understanding of how much the 4dsw affects outcomes, each community must ultimately decide how to weigh which outcomes matter the most.

  abstract = {The four-day school week (4dsw) is growing in popularity, especially in rural areas across the western United States. RAND Corporation researchers addressed knowledge gaps about the 4dsw by conducting a large-scale study of the implementation and outcomes of the 4dsw that involved the collection of original data in numerous districts across Idaho, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, as well as administrative data from these and other states. The researchers analyzed both qualitative and quantitative data to compare the 4dsw and five-day school week (5dsw). The analyses resulted in mixed findings. Advocates of the 4dsw argue that the shorter week saves money, improves student attendance, and helps recruit and retain teachers in rural districts. Cost savings related to the four-day model were relatively small, but savings due to a 4dsw may be used to maintain the level of instructional expenses in the face of revenue shortages. There was no quantitative evidence that the 4dsw improved student attendance. Qualitative data supported the view that the model helps attract and retain teachers. Families and students reported highly valuing the extra time that the 4dsw allowed them to spend together, and the data showed that, overall, stakeholders experienced high levels of satisfaction with the 4dsw. However, a comparison of English language arts and math test scores showed that students on the 4dsw have lower scores, over time, when compared with peers on a five-day schedule. Given these mixed findings, communities are likely to make different choices about the 4dsw depending on their goals and the local context. [For the research brief, see ED615238.

  abstract = {According to the US. Department of Labor, 1991, the United States education has shifted the focused to student performance and academic success (NCEE, 2006). School districts across the nation have increased students' academic demands, including increased academic instruction time, while the allotted time for recess and academic breaks continuously decrease, significantly impacting the school day's structure (Brusseau \& Hannon, 2015; Ginsburg et al., 2007; Stonehill et al., 2011). However, research asserted that instructional time increase does not significantly impact student achievement. In contrast, the increase of academic instruction time could stimulate behavioral problems and sedentary behaviors, while the continuous decrease of recess time could, as cited by Stapp and Karr, p. 22, ``be detrimental to students' physical activity levels, social development, and academic achievement'' (McManus et al., 2015; Thapa et al., 2013). Taking purposeful, frequent breaks from academics is an essential part of the school day for students; conversely, schools' primary focus is improving scores and increasing academic rigor, rather than teaching and enriching the whole child (Ramstetter et al., 2010; Dewey, 1938). The qualitative study was initiated to gain elementary teacher perception regarding the impact breaks have on student engagement. The study's design included the instrumentation of a researcher-created teacher survey and classroom observations in the elementary setting. The survey and classroom observation data were analyzed through an inductive and deductive data analysis process, by forming reasonable themes through coding the data collections and verifying theme validity through an analysis of the supporting data under each theme (Burkholder et al., 2020; Creswell \& Creswell, 2018). The data analysis of the teacher survey and classroom observations indicated a positive association between student breaks and student engagement behaviors, specifically after a break. Elementary teacher effectiveness plays a crucial role in student engagement, including implementing appropriate classroom-based breaks at the appropriate time. The culmination of qualitative data indicated that breaks between scheduled recess breaks are essential for student engagement stamina and decreasing distracting behaviors. The study and prior research align, as elementary students must receive frequent, adequate, and appropriate breaks throughout the school day (Barr-Anderson et al., 2011; Ramstetter \& Murray, 2017; Yogman et al., 2018).},

On the basis of the literature review, a questionnaire was developed. Participants were superintendents in Nebraska school districts who were asked to identify their own attitudes and also to estimate community attitudes toward selected procedural changes. Data were analyzed primarily through crosstabulation procedures.    Findings from the literature review suggested that communities objected less to operational changes than school administrators; energy conservation through mid-winter school closing found widest acceptance among administrators.    Data from the study indicated that there was little support for the suggested procedural changes. Conclusions from the study were as follows:  (1) Superintendents believed that communities were very concerned about energy costs but were reluctant to individually provide transportation for after-school activities. (2) Superintendents from school districts with fewer than 500 students were more inclined to accept the four-day week than superintendents from schools with higher enrollments. (3) Superintendents felt that the community would prefer a seasonal adjustment in the start of the school day rather than other alternatives, whereas the superintendents accorded this calendar option only a fourth place ranking. (4) Superintendents favored the mid-winter closing; their second choice was the calendar with the four- or five-day school week dependent on the season of the year. (5) Superintendents believed that nearly 21 percent of the community or parents supporting after-school activities would be willing to provide after-school transportation in order to conserve energy. (6) Superintendents who agreed that a change in the existing school calendar would lead to a reduction in energy consumption preferred the mid-winter closing; their second choice was the seasonal change in the start of the school day.},

While some schools have continued with this alternative scheduling option, more school districts are taking a renewed interest in this option as a way to curtail shrinking budgets and increasing transportation expenses. This study examined the perceptions of the implementation of the four-day school week in one rural Missouri school district through three pivotal points in time. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological case study was to examine the perceptions of the parents, teachers, administrators, support staff, and community members regarding the four-day school week at the initial decision, once the new schedule began, and after two years of implementing the four-day school week. The researcher anticipated the knowledge garnered from this case study would provide valuable information that the participating district would find useful to improve its existing four-day school week and that other schools might find useful while deciding if implementing a four-day school week is right for their district. This case study examined certain perceptions regarding the four-day school week, including student academic achievement, absenteeism in students and staff, and morale of students and staff, as well as any other issues the participants felt compelled to share. The study used an online survey with a Likert scale, as well as a questionnaire containing open-ended questions. The overwhelming majority of respondents felt that the four-day school week had improved student academic success, reduced absenteeism, and enhanced overall morale. However, several parents did note some other concerns that this school and others should regard as genuine concerns.},

Research has shown a lack of dedicated time is among the issues that hinder effective professional learning. While the four-day school week is typically used to address budget issues for rural schools, the schedule's flexibility may be uniquely able to aid professional learning efforts. The purpose of this study was to determine the differences between professional learning practices in Missouri's four- and five-day schools. The Standards for Professional Learning, created by Learning Forward, served as the theoretical framework. The researcher obtained permission from Learning Forward to collect data using the organization's Standards Assessment Inventory (SAI) survey instrument. Teachers from 18 Missouri four-day schools and 21 comparable five-day schools based on size, RPDC region, and free and reduced lunch population were included in the study. The teachers responded via online survey distributed by email. Statistical analysis included independent sample two-tailed t-tests adjusted for unequal sample sizes at the p {$<$} 0.05 level. Missouri four-day teachers rated the Learning Communities, Leadership, and Data standards significantly higher than their five-day counterparts did. The findings of this study add to the sparse body of literature related to the four-day school week and professional learning practices. The study concluded that the four-day school week may help schools improve professional learning practices due to the unique availability of professional development time on the off-day.},

Current research findings offer evidence that structuring time for student learning is an important factor in student achievement.  School district superintendents are challenged with the issue of structuring time for optimal student learning and maintaining ideal transportation routes, school activities, and community support. The goal of this project was to determine if superintendents possess knowledge of structuring time for optimal student learning and apply those various strategies to effectively structure time in their districts' school scheduling process.    Three strategies were identified to effectively structure time for optimal student learning through a review of literature. The strategies are: alternative calendars, start times, and flexibility for mastery within the daily schedule. The definition for each strategy was created through research in literature and review of an expert panel, which resulted in the definitions used in the project. A set of interview questions and an analysis instrument were developed for use during conversations with superintendents to determine the superintendents' knowledge and application of structuring time for optimal student learning.    The qualitative analysis of the superintendent interviews concluded even though each superintendent interviewed recognized some of the knowledge and research supporting structuring time for optimal student learning, none identified application of all strategies suggested by literature.  Furthermore, other circumstances were recognized that seemed to affect superintendents' application of structuring time for optimal student learning. Recommendations were made to superintendents. The goal of the recommendations was to improve the superintendents' knowledge and application of structuring time for optimal student learning for future scheduling processes that occur at the district and building level.},

This collective case study was undertaken to examine the perceptions of administrators, school counselors, and teachers on the four-day school week and the impact of the new calendar format on teacher recruitment, teacher retention, and job satisfaction. Three school districts were studied; each began implementation of the four-day school week during the 2015-2016 academic year. A total of 21 school personnel were interviewed, including three superintendents, three building administrators, three school counselors, and 12 teachers. Participants overwhelmingly identified the four-day school week as a benefit to them personally, citing the ability to balance work and family as positive. Employees of two of the three school districts reported improved ability to recruit potential candidates for teaching positions. Educators from all three districts reported an improvement in teacher retention, as the four-day schedule is very popular with teachers. Also noted as valuable and important to the teaching staff is the additional time for professional development and collaboration built into the school calendar. Given the difficulties small rural school districts frequently face when securing and retaining a highly qualified teaching staff, the findings of this study point to an unintended, yet powerful outcome of implementation of the four-day school week--the ability to recruit and retain teachers.

  abstract = {This study examines the effects of changing from a five-day to a four-day school week on academic achievement for public schools in Oklahoma, a state which ranks high on poverty and near the bottom on educational quality compared to other states. Yet since 2013, Oklahoma school districts have increasingly adopted the four-day school week in response to less state spending on education. We use clustered-regression analysis and a sample of 1,336 schools from public-use Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) data to examine the effect on the measure, a school's academic report card score, for those who have experienced the shift from a five-day to a four-day school week over the period 2012 to 2016. This research finds a negative relationship between the change to a four-day school week and school report card scores, compared to schools that maintained a five-day school week. These results differ from those found in similar studies in other states, highlighting the importance of considering unique socioeconomic factors inherent to a state when implementing policy changes that affect our vulnerable future.  And for Oklahoma, the switch to a four-day school week has for the most part been felt by children in rural schools, who are already economically challenged, so this may widen the already existing academic achievement gap between richer and poorer students.},

  abstract = {The four-day school model is gaining popularity in rural districts across the United States. The four-day model has been touted as a model that produces benefits for rural communities. The four-day school week has been cited as creating benefits as well as consequences, however, there is limited research into the area of special education. The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the effects that a four-day school week has on students who receive special education services. It also aims to explore the perceptions of the special education team of the impact the four-day school week has on the achievement and regression of learned material for students who receive special education services. The design of the study included the collection of perceptual data through surveys and semi-structured interviews. Data and discussion to the findings would be beneficial to district leaders seeking to implement the four-day model in the future.},

  abstract = {Between 2008 and 2012, thirteen Minnesota school districts switched from the traditional five-day school week to a four-day week, giving students one additional day off each week. This study examined the impact that the adoption of a four-day school week has had on the travel patterns of households with children in Minnesota. The study found that the four-day school schedule caused statistically significant, sizable increases in ``day trips'' -- trips that are at least 50 miles away from home but require no overnight stay. The number and nature of ``weekend trips'' remained unaffected by the four-day week. The study found that households in four and five-day districts took the same number of trips, with a similar number of travelers, had similar lengths of stay and spent similar amounts of money on weekend trips. The increase in day trips may, however, have come at the cost of longer vacation travel -- trips of five days or longer. The study found a significantly smaller number of longer trips reported by parents in four-day districts than by similar parents in five-day districts. Approximately one in three families took one less long trip over a two year period, due to the four-day week (a 27 percent change from the number of trips taken by the average family in this sample). This resulted in a similar percent drop in nights spent in hotels (nearly 1.5 nights for a 28 percent decline) and overall expenditures (\$675 for a 29 percent decline). The long trips that four-day households skipped were disproportionally in-state. Four-day week families were nine percentage points less likely to take an in-state trip (a 40 percent drop from the  average share of in state trips in the sample). Among households that traveled at least once, one in five took one fewer trip in-state (a 49 percent change from the sample average). This implied an 11 percentage point (or 61 percent from the sample average) decline in the probability of having used a MN hotel over a two year period.},

The alternative schedule was approved by the Wyoming State Board of Education on two conditions. First, the State Attorney General must affirm the State Board's right to permit alternative scheduling. Second, an outside evaluation of the approach must be made. The services of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory were contracted by the District to plan and conduct an impartial evaluation. The overall purpose of the evaluation was to provide information which would be of value in weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative schedule. The most apparent effect of the four-day schedule was the generation of interest, enthusiasm and support  for quality schooling on the part of all segments of the educational community--parents, teachers, students, and administrators. While the findings hint at benefits to be realized from the Sheridan plan, neither positive nor negative outcomes in student achievement could be shown. The community impact was split: most parents saw Fridays as positive opportunities for family activities, but families where both parents were working and the children were of elementary age viewed the four-day week negatively.

The product will provide school districts with a resource to address their needs, questions, and concerns around all aspects of the transition to a four-day school week, including policy, community relations, human resources, scheduling, finances, and student achievement. Over the past five years, weakening economic conditions have wreaked havoc across the country in most industries. Missouri public school districts have not been spared the hardship, as decreases in property tax subsidies and state budget shortfalls create lasting deficiencies in funding. With the passage of four-day school week/alternative calendar legislation, this economic crisis has spurred school districts in Missouri and across the nation to investigate options for an alternative calendar or four-day school week in order to reduce spending. The need for an operations manual surfaced as the team examined four-day school week research and during the interviews of state department leaders from many states expressing limited guidance existed for districts investigating or making the transition to a four-day school week. District leaders considering this change have been forced to conduct their own research and develop an implementation plan without any guidance. As more and more districts consider this option, it will be beneficial for them to have a guide with the resources needed to implement the four-day school week. The purpose of this study was to identify what school leaders and policymakers need to know when considering or implementing a four-day school week. An expert panel, consisting of school leaders and state education officials knowledgeable in educational policy and in the research and practice of school district administration reviewed the operations manual as part of the pilot. Following the expert panel review, the manual was refined based on recommendations and submitted to another expert panel for field test feedback. A complete evaluation of the final field-test recommendations and revisions were incorporated into the manual. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Attendance data were available for the entire school district.  Student achievement data was available for third grade through tenth grade. The statistical test for attendance was a population proportion.  The statistical test for student achievement was a paired t test. The theoretical foundation was based on Marzano's model where  time was the most important factor for learning.  However, results of the current study indicated a decline in attendance and a statistically significant increase in student achievement.

Two southern Oregon schools implemented the 4-day school week on a trial basis in 1982-83 and, along with five eastern Oregon districts, continue to use this schedule today. The primary purpose of the change to a 4-day week was reduction in cost. According to the enthusiastic responses of parents, staff, and students on annual surveys, the 4-day week produced: (1) a 15\% to 23\% reduction in transportation costs plus additional savings in energy costs and nonteacher salaries; (2) more actual learning time due to less set-up time and fewer interruptions; (3) more time for staff development, extracurricular activities, and family business; (4) less student and teacher absenteeism; (5) higher teacher morale and student enthusiasm; (6) more parental involvement; and (7) no adverse effects on student achievement. The following disadvantages have been noted: (1) difficulties if restoration of the 5-day week is desired; (2) increased costs for some parents; (3) increased teacher stress; (4) tiredness in younger children; (5) the impact of holidays on the schedule; and (6) concerns about the national movement toward a longer school year. An additional three eastern Oregon districts have successfully implemented a four and one half-day week.

  abstract = {The purpose for conducting this study was to determine whether inequitable capital outlay capacity, as defined by district valuation, was associated statistically with the following cost-saving measures: implementation of a 4-day school week, reduction in instructional time, or increasing class sizes. Traditionally, these cost-saving measures are associated with expenditures in a schools district's general fund; however, the current study builds upon previous research by Hime and Maiden (2017) who documented an advantage for districts with healthy capital outlay from ``crossover funding,'' which are expenditures allowable from multiple revenue sources. The utilization of crossover funding creates a disequalizing effect on equitably distributed revenue. When budget reductions occur in state aid, logic follows all districts should be equally impacted because the revenue is distributed equitably. Therefore, district wealth should not be associated with these operational cost-saving measures. This study found statistically significant relationships between schools districts' per-pupil valuations, a 4-day school week, reductions in instructional time, and increased class sizes, indicating that inequitable capital funding in Oklahoma was associated with a decrease in equity for state aid revenue. Specifically, class sizes were inversely associated with district wealth across all years of the study. The results indicate the more than 600,000 Oklahoma students in districts with low property values are disadvantaged by larger classes, a 4-day school week, and a decreased amount of instructional time compared to their peers in wealthier districts.},

  abstract = {This study was a comparative study using selected characteristics of four-day week schools and five-day week schools in rural New Mexico. In recent years, reform efforts have called for an increase in the number of school days per year. However, little research has been done about the comparisons of four-day and five-day week schools. This study contributed to the research concerning student achievement and variable school calendars.    The purpose of the study was to compare student achievement, student satisfaction, and faculty satisfaction in K-12 rural four-day and five-day New Mexico school districts. All school districts in the study had enrollments of 400 average daily membership or less. Student achievement was analyzed over an eight-year period. Student and faculty member satisfaction was correlated with 1989 student achievement.    Several analyses were used to compare the variables. Student achievement in small rural schools was analyzed by a three-way ANOVA using grade level, days per week, and the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) scores as variables. The 1989 CTBS scores were compared to student and faculty satisfaction, as measured by-the National Association of Secondary School Principal's (NASSP) Comprehensive Assessment of School Environments, using multiple regression techniques. Using discriminant analysis, student satisfaction and student achievement also predicted the number of days per week that students were in school.    The study indicated that CTBS scores of students in grades five and eight were significantly different ({$<$}0.05) between small rural four-day week schools and small rural five-day week schools in New Mexico. The four-day week student scores were significantly higher than the five-day week scores over an eight-year period.    Indicators of student and faculty satisfaction, as determined by the NASSP Satisfaction Surveys, showed no significant correlation with CTBS scores for the 1989 school year. When predicting student membership in a four-day or five-day week school, the discriminant analysis technique was accurate approximately 66\% of the time.    As a result of this research, recommendations were made to study community and parental attitudes toward four-day week schools. Further research was also recommended concerning expenditures to improve direct instruction by four-day week schools.},

  abstract = {In 1980, the Colorado State Legislature passed legislation which enabled 12 southeastern Colorado school districts with enrollments from 30 to 330 to experiment with a 4-day school week as an alternative to reducing programs. Each district was allowed to determine which weekday its schools would not be in session, length of the school day, and actual number of days in the school year. To evaluate the program questionnaires were sent to students in grades 4-8 and grades 9-12, to all parents of school-age children, and to all certified and non-certified staff. Findings indicated that, although the districts implemented the 4-day schedule with many variations and different objectives, all districts demonstrated the potential of the schedule to save energy and transportation costs and to reduce student and teacher absenteeism. Achievement levels for students were comparable to their performance before going to the innovative schedule. Parents, teachers, and students all favored the 4-day week over the 5-day week by a wide margin. Strategic considerations (increased energy saving versus convenient extracurricular activity scheduling) surrounded the decision to take Monday or Friday off. The districts achieved notable cost savings in gasoline consumption and maintenance costs for buses, electrical consumption, and substitute teacher costs. (Author/CM)},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to provide school administrators information about implementation of the four-day school week. Advantages and disadvantages were discussed in addition to reviewing specific areas of cost effectiveness, student achievement, and staff development. Questionnaires were mailed in April, 1984 to sixty-two public school officials throughout the United States representing eight states that operated the four-day school week. Fifty questionnaires were returned yielding an 80.6 percent return. A review of the literature revealed that the four-day school week was a relatively new concept in school scheduling, having been in existence since the early 1970s. The primary reasons for implementing the four-day school were overcrowdedness, conserving energy, and reducing overall operating costs. Some of the findings and conclusions based on the analysis of data follow: Findings. (1) Colorado is the leading state in the United States which has school districts operating on the four-day school week, followed by New Mexico and Minnesota. Other states reporting experience with the four-day schedule include Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Utah. (2) One-hundred percent of the responding schools implementing the four-day schedule were from rural communities with seventy-six percent of the districts having enrollments of less than 1000 students. (3) The non-school day most frequently chosen was evenly divided between Monday and Friday. The four school days were commonly extended sixty or ninety minutes to equal the same amount of instructional time as the five-day schedule. (4) Although teacher salaries remained the same, cost savings from five to twenty percent in transportation, food service, custodial supplies, and heating costs were realized by implementing the four-day school week. (5) Ninety-seven percent of the superintendents indicated that the four-day school week had improved or not affected student achievement during the first year of implementation. Conclusions. (1) The four-day school week is perceived as being successful in reducing operating costs, maintaining student achievement, reducing student and staff absenteeism, and improving morale of students and faculty. (2) The disadvantages of the four-day school week may be the supervision of students in the community on the non-school day and the longer school day for small children.

The purpose of this two-way repeated measures of ANOVA quantitative study was to analyze the transition of Missouri four-day public school districts and determine if the four-day school week impacted student attendance and student discipline incidents. The quantitative research found the four-day school week does not significantly impact student attendance or student discipline incident rates. Implications for policy and practice included researching the variety of ways to implement a compressed school and workweek and creating an action plan to track school district data, including student attendance and student discipline incidents, because the success of the four-day school week depends on the school community.},

Data were derived from: (1) surveys of all district stakeholders, which included 2,039 K-12 students, 492 parents, 103 teachers, and 85 support staff; (2) a comparison of student-achievement scores with previous years; (3) classroom observations of engaged time; (4) an analysis of student, teacher, and staff absenteeism data; and (5) cost-factor analyses. Findings indicate that student achievement increased at some grade levels, and at other grade levels it was comparable with achievement for previous years. Other outcomes included high levels of student on-task behaviors, less disruption of instructional time,  sustained student engagement, a decrease in employee and student absenteeism, and an approximate 1.6 percent savings in the district budget. However, the district abandoned the 4-day week after 1 year of implementation. Abandonment of the 4-day week is attributed to the district's lack of the following key elements of systematic change--vision, public and political support, cooperative networks, attention to teachers and learning, clearly defined administrative roles and responsibilities, and policy alignment. Two tables are included. (LMI)},

Research Questions 1 through 3 addressed district performance including teacher/staff and student attendance, achievement on the state assessment in reading and math, and costs on utilities. Research Question 4 addressed stakeholder perception. Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and collective impact theory served as the foundation for this study. The purposive sample included 40 internal and external stakeholders. Data collected included archival documents, semistructured interviews, and a structured questionnaire. A quantitative trend analysis was conducted on archival documents. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on interview perception data and structured questionnaire data was recoded for frequency. Archival data revealed natural gas costs decreased, student attendance improved, teacher/staff attendance declined, math scores dropped, reading scores were flat, and water/electricity costs increased. Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district. The implications for this study are a resource and lessons learned for district personnel seeking to eliminate a day of instruction for the purposes of saving money.},

Public school districts have implemented a four-day school week for multiple reasons including financial reasons and teacher recruitment and retention. This qualitative study seeks to determine if an impact exists on teacher preparation following implementation of a four-day school week by answering the research question, what are the perceptions of elementary building principals of the impact of a four-day school week on their teachers' instructional preparation. To better understand a four-day school week this study includes a brief history of public school calendars and alternative calendar types. This study also researches other areas within public schools that might be impacted in a four-day school week change. Missouri public school elementary building principals were interviewed and this data was analyzed by the researcher to determine if an impact existed on their teachers following a four-day school week implementation. Research data in this qualitative study showed that in the represented schools teacher preparation was affected in four areas, time management, curriculum awareness, collaboration and teacher morale. The intent of this study is to assist public school districts in decision-making regarding implementation of a four-day school week calendar.},

  abstract = {This study looked to gauge the effects of the four-day school week on music programs and aims to provide a broad range of resources and strategies for music educators to integrate into their existing practices. A 28 question online survey was administered using mixed item types (Likert-type, multiple choice and open-ended) to music educators from across the United States who are representative of school districts in all educational settings (i.e., rural, semi-rural, suburban and urban). Section I (questions 1-8) collected music educators and program demographic data to determine if they comprise a representative sample. Questions 9-13 discussed the personal impact the schedule has had on the music teacher, their opinions on it and their personal perception of the schedule. Next, questions 14-16 reviewed how the transition to the four-day work week has affected the instruction and preparation for the music classroom. Lastly, questions 17-19 addressed the impact the modified schedule has had on student participation and success. The final question (20), was an open ended answer that allows band directors to leave any important information that they think the researcher should know. The results of the survey found that the frequency of instruction and decrease in instructional time creates limitations on curriculum, ensembles and concert literature. However, many teachers found the schedule to have personal benefits. Music programs must in turn adapt to the circumstances in creative ways to engage students on a consistent basis. The findings also showed that to be successful on the shortened schedule, results indicated that educators must maintain high levels of student's engagement, adjusting repertoire to fit the realities of less instructional time, extra review time and by having a strong student assessment system in place. The implications of the four-day school week on school music programs are discussed fully in the final chapter.},

However, little research has been done on how school schedules potentially impact teachers' morale. The purpose of this qualitative, exploratory case study aims to understand how different types of school schedules (calendars) can affect teachers' morale. Teachers from Missouri elementary schools volunteered to participate in a survey that was posted on my personal Facebook page. There were a total of 71 certified Missouri Elementary teachers who agreed and volunteered for the study. The data was collected from the survey and 11 of the 61 participants volunteered to participate in a recorded one-on-one interview. The key findings of the research study varied based on the school schedules and the four research questions; (a) RQ1. How do teacher understand the traditional school schedule affect their (teachers') morale?; (b) RQ2. How do teachers understand year-round school schedules as they may affect their (teachers') morale?; (c) RQ3. How do teachers understand the four-day-a-week school schedule as it may affect their (teachers') morale?; (d) RQ4. How do teachers understand the pandemic mandate of entirely digital learning due to COVID-19 impacted teachers' morale?  Participants stated that time was a significant factor for teachers' morale. Some other aspects that affected teachers' morale were the breaks throughout the school year, classroom schedules, risk and safety factors, stress from additional responsibilities, and additional workloads.  This study's results provide important implications for school districts to increase retention, improve morale, and improve culture. Increased morale in school buildings will help teachers, administrators, and students in their academic missions. Some recommendations would be to look at the classroom schedules, break schedules throughout the school year, and provide additional uninterrupted plan time.},

In addition, the purpose of this study was to further investigate district leaders reasoning of making the move to the four-day school week schedule and their perceptions. Plus, there was inquiry to validate if teacher's perceptions were mostly positive or negative in regard to teaching reading, teacher collaboration and student reading achievement utilizing the four-day school week schedule. For the student data portion of the study, there were nine independent sample t tests administered between 13 four-day and demographically matched five-day school districts to determine if there were any significant differences between 3rd through 5th grade students MAP reading proficiency mean scores from 2017 to 2019. The results of the t tests indicated there were no significant differences in reading proficiency mean scores between any of the matched four-day and five-day school districts. There were 31 superintendent surveys gathered which indicated that the main reason for moving to the four-day week schedule was to recruit and retain quality teachers and the consensus to continue with the four-day week schedule was unanimous. There were 55 teacher survey responses collected which stated teacher's perceptions of the four-day school week had an overall positive impact on the amount of reading instruction time, teacher collaboration, and altogether student reading achievement. The findings of this study have implications for rural school district leaders, staff, and communities that are interested in switching from a five-day to the four-day school week. Also, rural school district leaders and communities should consider the findings of this study in regard to teacher recruitment and retention, teacher collaboration opportunities, and elementary student reading achievement. Recommendations for further research could include a larger sample size of student data by adding 6th grade through 12th grade comparisons of reading proficiency scores between four-day and five-day school week districts. It is recommended that further survey research could be conducted through a qualitative study with more detailed survey questions to superintendent and staff by means of short answer response.},

The MontCAS is the standardized assessment in reading, mathematics, and science adopted by the Montana Office of Public Instruction as a result of mandates from the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. In the spring of 2005, the Montana Legislature approved changes to the accreditation standards in Montana by allowing a school to be accredited based upon a total number of contact hours instead of the previous requirement of a minimum number of contact hours and a minimum number of days of instruction. Ten schools made the conversion to a four day week beginning in the 2006-2007 school year. By 2008-2009 there were 22 schools following a four day week calendar and over the next several years, this number doubled every two years. By the 2012-2013 school year, there were over 100 schools in Montana with a four day week. Data was provided by the Montana Office of Public Instruction on every student from every school in Montana that utilized the four day school week from implementation through the 2012-2013 school year. This data was analyzed by cohort based upon the year of implementation of the four day week in addition to being considered in the composite as the number of students tested in schools with the four day week grew from just over 200 in the spring of 2007 to 2685 in the spring of 2013. The total percentage of students identified as proficient and advanced was compared to state-wide averages disaggregated by cohort and in composite over the academic years of 2006-2007 through 2012-2013. Findings indicate that student achievement may increase the first year of implementation of the four day week, but over time, student achievement decreases, compared to the rest of the students in the state of Montana.},

  abstract = {Four-day school weeks are used in over 1,600 schools across twenty-four states but little is known about adoption and implementation of these types of school calendars. Through examinations of school calendars and correspondence with school districts, we have compiled the most complete four-day school week dataset to date. We use this unique database to conduct a comprehensive analysis of four-day school week policy adoption and implementation. We find adoption of four-day school weeks is often financially motivated and has generally remained a small, rural district phenomenon. These schedules feature a day off once a week\textemdash often Friday\textemdash with increased time in school on each of the remaining four school days that, on average, is nearly an hour longer than the national average among five-day schools. Four-day school week schedules average only 148 school days per year, resulting in less time in school than the national average for five-day schools (180 days per year) despite the longer school days. Substantial heterogeneity exists in the structure of these schedules across states, which may help explain differential four-day school week effects on student outcomes across institutional settings in the previous literature.},

While these shorter school weeks potentially help reduce costs, this study considers the implications these school schedules have on student achievement. This study uses a difference-in-differences analysis using a panel data set of student-level test scores to examine the effects of the adoption of these four-day school weeks on student achievement in the State of Oregon from 2007-2015.I find that these school schedules have detrimental impacts on student achievement, with declines of between 0.044 and 0.053 standard deviations in math scores and declines of 0.033 and 0.038 standard deviations in reading scores. The results suggest that four-day school weeks are more detrimental for the math and reading achievement of boys and the reading achievement of low-income students. Earlier school start times and lost instructional time of nearly three and a half hours a week appear to be the primary mechanisms underlying these achievement losses.},

It appears that reductions in time in school, which amount to three to four hours per week, largely drive these achievement declines. Using four-day school week adoption as an instrument for weekly time in school, I find that a one-hour increase in weekly time in school leads to a 0.018 standard deviation increase in math achievement and a 0.006 standard deviation increase in reading achievement. Finally, I compare the cost savings-achievement trade-off of the four-day school week with other traditional cost savings approaches and find that the four-day school week yields a comparable cost savings-achievement trade-off to many of these other interventions.},

We estimate these effects using a difference-in-differences design with data from the Stanford Educational Data Archive and a proprietary longitudinal national database of four-day school week use from 2009 to 2018. We find reductions in both math and English/language arts achievement when examining four-day school weeks nationally, but these aggregate effects appear to be masking important heterogeneity due to differences in overall time in school across districts. When stratifying four-day week districts into districts with low, middle, and high levels of time in school, we find statistically significant negative effects on math achievement for four-day school week districts with low time in school, but no statistically significant effects for four-day school week districts with middle or high time in school. Our findings suggest that maintaining sufficient overall time in school should be a key consideration for school districts contemplating four-day school week adoption.},

However, the impacts of FDSWs on physical activity exposure and related outcomes are unknown. This study examined physical education (PE) exposure and childhood obesity prevalence in 4- versus 5-day Oregon schools; the authors hypothesized lower PE exposure and higher obesity in FDSW schools, given reduced school environment exposure. Methods: The authors utilized existing data from Oregon to compare 4- versus 5-day models: t tests compared mean school-level factors (PE exposure, time in school, enrollment, and demographics) and complex samples weighted t tests compared mean child-level obesity data for a state representative sample of first to third graders (N\,=\,4625). Results: Enrollment, time in school, and student\textendash teacher ratio were significantly lower in FDSW schools. FDSW schools provided significantly more PE, both in minutes (120 vs 101 min/wk in 4- vs 5-d schools, P\,{$<$}\,.01) and relative to total time in school (6.9\% vs 5.0\%, P\,{$<$}\,.0001). Obesity prevalence did not differ significantly between school models. Conclusion: Greater PE exposure in FDSW schools was observed, and it remains unknown whether differences in PE exposure contributed to obesity prevalence in this sample of students. Efforts to better understand how FDSWs impact physical activity, obesity risk, and related factors are needed.},

This study examined associations of reduced school exposure via FDSWs with adolescent health and risk behaviors, obesity, and food security. METHODS Self-report data from 8th- and 11th-grade students from the Oregon Healthy Teens survey across 5 survey years (odd years 2007-2015, total N = 91,860-104,108 respondents depending on the survey question) were linked to a FDSW indicator. Regression analyses controlling for student and school characteristics compared outcomes between students in 4- and 5-day schools overall (without school fixed effects) and outcomes associated with switching to a FDSW (with school fixed effects). RESULTS When controlling for multiple student- and school-level factors, we observed adolescents in FDSW schools report they consume sugar sweetened beverages more frequently and water less frequently, have access to fewer days of physical education, are more likely to be food insecure, and are more likely to report the use of any drugs and specifically marijuana than 5-day school week students.

  abstract = {The American public school system has used the same agrarian-based calendar for the past century despite drastic changes to the educational system. In recent years, some schools have come under financial burdens associated with poor test scores that correlate with funding under legislation. These financial burdens have impacted rural school districts that allocate up to 5\% of their budget to transportation. Some schools seek to alleviate these burdens by implementing nontraditional schedules. Among these schedules, the 4-day week has become increasingly popular since the 1970's. Research on the 4-day week has primarily been focused on its impact on financial saving and student achievement. School culture is an important factor in any school building as it impacts teacher satisfaction and student achievement. The researcher sought to understand teachers' perceptions of the impact of a 4-day week on school culture as little research had been done in this area. The researcher used Steve Grunert's School Culture Survey (SCS) as a quantitative tool to collect data from participants utilizing a 4-day school week and participants in similar schools utilizing a 5-day school week in Oklahoma. This tool can be divided into 6 categories that promote a positive, collaborative culture: collaborative leadership, teacher collaboration, professional development, unity of purpose, collegial support, and learning partnership. The data from the SCS showed statistical significance in the areas of collaborative leadership, teacher collaboration, and learning partnership.},

Estimates indicate that, among mothers with children all between ages 5 and 13, increasing four-day week enrollment from zero to 25\% of an area's students causes an 11\% decrease in employment (7.6 percentage points) and decreases of a similar magnitude in hours and weeks worked, and the probability of reporting any wage or salary income, relative to baseline levels. In contrast to these estimates, among single mothers I find no negative employment effects and also find that the policy led to an 18\% increase in the incidence of working year-round relative to working fewer weeks per year. The labor supply of married fathers was not affected by adoption of the four-day school week in a statistically significant manner. Finally, I estimate small but precise increases in moving in response to the policy in subsequent years and show that there is significant heterogeneity in labor supply responses among married mothers according to educational level, with most of the negative effects accruing to mothers with a four-year college degree or greater.},

Chapter 1 assesses the effect of the 4DW on parental labor supply and other measures of household welfare. Difference-in-differences results indicate that married mothers of all grade-school-aged children reduce employment and hours worked in an economic and statistically significant manner in response to the 4DW. Both married fathers and single mothers do not reduce employment and reduce their hours worked in only a marginally significant manner. Chapter 2 describes a meaningful decline in both employment and presence at work among married mothers of grade-school-aged children across the months of the summer break. Single mothers reduce their summer labor supply less and I observe some responsiveness among married fathers in presence at work over the summer. The role of this decline in summer labor supply on the gender gap in experience and earnings, as well as household time use and child cognitive and non-cognitive skills are also explored.},

  abstract = {This study was conducted to determine whether a significant difference existed between principals working in public elementary schools in Missouri using a traditional, five-day schedule and principals working in public elementary schools in Missouri that use an alternative, four-day schedule when comparing their perceptions of work-life balance, time for self-care, work-related stress, self-efficacy, and overall job satisfaction. An electronic survey was sent to public elementary schools in Missouri utilizing both four-day and five-day calendars. The survey instrument included questions in the areas of work-life balance, time for self-care, work-related stress, self-efficacy, and overall job satisfaction as well as demographic information. Results were analyzed after performing a series of Mann-Whitney tests to determine statistical significance. Results showed those with five- day work weeks had higher agreement that they felt anxious thinking about work while those with four-day work weeks reported their work had more meaning for them. Key findings from this study should give insights to district administrators and school boards to make informed decisions regarding the school week calendar when trying to attract and retain staff.},

  abstract = {The popularity of the four-day school week trends upward each year, and policymakers are concerned about the lack of literature on the shorter school and its effect on academic outcomes. The purpose of this causal-comparative quantitative study was to investigate if academic achievement differences existed between four-day and five-day weeks in New Mexico. Standardized test scores were compared to determine if a difference existed between two independent groups of students, those attending four-day schools and those attending five-day schools. A sample of standardized test scores from the 2018-2019 school year for New Mexico's 89 public school districts showed test scores for English (N = 1,093) and math (N = 860) were statistically similar amongst the two groups of students: four-day students (English: M = 747.35, SD = 34.20; and Algebra II: M = 708.65, SD = 28.187); and five-day students (English: M = 748.86, SD = 36.43; Algebra II: M = 706.88, SD = 30.952). Results of the independent-samples t-test showed the independent variable (length of the school week) had no statistical impact on the dependent variable (academic achievement) and the samples were statistically similar.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate the efficiency of the four-day school week program in relation to the cost of operation and effectiveness of curriculum. The study attempted to gather information for the benefit of school districts and administrators that may want to adopt a four-day program in the future. Advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Procedures for implementation are also included for evaluation in reducing effective schools.    School superintendents of four-day programs were surveyed to gain current information. The survey included demographic questions, cost efficiency questions about the school, and student achievement. Open ended questions were included to solicit responses as to the strength and weaknesses of four-day programs.    The findings indicated that school superintendents generally agree four-day programs are successful primarily in small rural areas. Schools do apparently show a reduction in operational costs. In comparing student achievement, the large majority of schools surveyed are performing as average or above both at their state level and nationally. The rankings are based on standardized achievement tests.    A list of advantages and disadvantages were compiled from surveys completed. The advantages were numerous and the disadvantages were limited. The most frequent advantages were lower costs, higher academics, and improved morale among students and staff. The advantages implied outweigh the disadvantages indicating a future for the four-day program in select regional areas.},

  abstract = {Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) are a best practice that has been around for decades; however, due to organizational structuring in elementary schools, teachers are allowed 30 minutes of planning time. During this time little planning or collaboration with peers is achieved. Previous research has proven that professional learning by way of collaboration with peers increases the teachers' ability to reach and teach the students which in turn results in student success. The problem addressed by this study was the allotted time provided for Georgia elementary teachers to develop professionally and how to obtain that time in a manner that improves teacher performance. The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to understand the perceptions of Georgia elementary teachers on what is considered an appropriate amount of time to collaboratively plan and develop professionally in order to impact their pedagogy to meet the needs of their elementary students; conduct direct observations; and collect specified documentation in an effort to identify what is considered an appropriate amount of time to collaboratively plan and develop professionally to impact their pedagogy to meet the needs of their elementary students. The data revealed the majority of elementary teachers who were interviewed perceive the current professional learning practices to be ineffective for improving teacher pedagogy and they perceived the current amount of time allotted for collaborative planning and professional development to be limited. They were also unable to offer suggestions of how to obtain what could be considered the appropriate amount of time for collaborative planning and professional development to improve teacher performance. Based on the findings, it appeared the elementary teachers are unfamiliar with the concept of PLCs as well as how they operate in a manner that can effectively improve teacher performance. Future research should include the perceptions district and building leaders possess on PLCs to ensure a proper understanding is held on the concept of PLCs.},

In 2011, former governor of Missouri, Jay Nixon, signed the optional four-day school week into law. The bill moved from requiring 174 days of instruction to a total of 1,044 hours for districts that wanted to go to four days. This project sought to find out what the 33 Missouri school districts that operated on a four-day school week during the 2018-2019 school year were doing on the fifth unscheduled day to address the comprehensive needs of the families and students they served. The project focuses on childcare, food insecurities and academic deficiencies and/or supplemental and extracurricular activities.},
